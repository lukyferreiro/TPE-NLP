Javier Milei argues that free market capitalism has lifted 90% of the world&#39;s population out of poverty and is the only morally desirable system to achieve it. He cites the historical data that shows how economic growth has accelerated since the 19th century and that countries with free markets are much richer than those with repressed markets.<br><br>2. <b>*Socialism*</b> is a failed system that leads to poverty and misery. Javier Milei argues that socialism has always and everywhere been a failure, and that it is responsible for the deaths of over 100 million people. He claims that the main problem with the West today is that it is being undermined by its own leaders who are advocating for socialism.<br><br>3. <b>*Neoclassical economic theory*</b> is flawed and leads to socialism. Javier Milei argues that neoclassical economic theory is based on a flawed model of the market, and that this leads to regulations that hinder economic growth and open the door to socialism. He claims that the solution to market failures is not more regulation, but less.<br><br>4. The <b>*West*</b> is in danger of embracing socialism. Javier Milei argues that the West is facing a significant threat because its leaders are co-opted by a world that inevitably leads to socialism. He warns that if the West continues on this path, it will condemn itself to poverty and misery.<br><br>5. <b>*Entrepreneurs*</b> are heroes who contribute to society. Javier Milei argues that entrepreneurs are not villains, but heroes who create jobs and contribute to the well-being of society. He encourages entrepreneurs not to be intimidated by the political class and to continue to create wealth.<br><br>6. The moral underpinnings of <b>*free market capitalism*</b> are superior to those of socialism. Javier Milei claims that free markets incentivize hard work and innovation, while socialism rewards idleness and discourages individual achievement.<br><br>7. Specific examples of how <b>*free markets*</b> have lifted people out of poverty are provided. Javier Milei mentions the economic booms in China and India in recent decades, and attributes these to their embrace of free market principles.<br><br>8. Acknowledging that <b>*free markets*</b> are not perfect, Javier Milei argues that the benefits of free markets far outweigh the drawbacks, and that the best way to address inequality is through economic growth, not government redistribution.<br><br>9. Javier Milei criticizes what he sees as a growing trend of <b>*anti-capitalism*</b> in the West. He blames this trend on a number of factors, including the rise of social media, the decline of traditional institutions, and the increasing influence of identity politics.<br><br>10. Javier Milei concludes with a **call to action**, urging viewers to defend free markets and to fight against the spread of socialism. He believes that the future of the West depends on our ability to preserve the principles of individual liberty and economic freedom.<br><br>Even though some details might be missed in this summary, I hope that you found it useful.",i have watched this video of javier mileis speech at the world economic forum and heres a summary of his main points for those who would rather read it than hear or watch it1 free market capitalism is the only way to end world poverty javier milei argues that free market capitalism has lifted 90 of the worlds population out of poverty and is the only morally desirable system to achieve it he cites the historical data that shows how economic growth has accelerated since the 19th century and that countries with free markets are much richer than those with repressed markets2 socialism is a failed system that leads to poverty and misery javier milei argues that socialism has always and everywhere been a failure and that it is responsible for the deaths of over 100 million people he claims that the main problem with the west today is that it is being undermined by its own leaders who are advocating for socialism3 neoclassical economic theory is flawed and leads to socialism javier milei argues that neoclassical economic theory is based on a flawed model of the market and that this leads to regulations that hinder economic growth and open the door to socialism he claims that the solution to market failures is not more regulation but less4 the west is in danger of embracing socialism javier milei argues that the west is facing a significant threat because its leaders are coopted by a world that inevitably leads to socialism he warns that if the west continues on this path it will condemn itself to poverty and misery5 entrepreneurs are heroes who contribute to society javier milei argues that entrepreneurs are not villains but heroes who create jobs and contribute to the wellbeing of society he encourages entrepreneurs not to be intimidated by the political class and to continue to create wealth6 the moral underpinnings of free market capitalism are superior to those of socialism javier milei claims that free markets incentivize hard work and innovation while socialism rewards idleness and discourages individual achievement7 specific examples of how free markets have lifted people out of poverty are provided javier milei mentions the economic booms in china and india in recent decades and attributes these to their embrace of free market principles8 acknowledging that free markets are not perfect javier milei argues that the benefits of free markets far outweigh the drawbacks and that the best way to address inequality is through economic growth not government redistribution9 javier milei criticizes what he sees as a growing trend of anticapitalism in the west he blames this trend on a number of factors including the rise of social media the decline of traditional institutions and the increasing influence of identity politics10 javier milei concludes with a call to action urging viewers to defend free markets and to fight against the spread of socialism he believes that the future of the west depends on our ability to preserve the principles of individual liberty and economic freedomeven though some details might be missed in this summary i hope that you found it useful,3117,Positive

Milei called her rivals everything from &quot;diabolical dwarves&quot; to &quot;blood-sucking parasites&quot;.<br>Milei is a dog lover and on this point there is something to say. His former favorite dog, Conan, has his own Wikipedia page. Milei has claimed that he and Conan first met in the Colosseum in a past life. Back then, 2,000 years ago, Conan was a lion and Milei a gladiator. But instead of fighting to the death, they became best friends.<br>Conan has since been cloned and these four clones are all named after economists that Milei likes and is inspired by.<br>Javier Milei often seeks out mediums and claims to be able to communicate with his late dog Conan. Incidentally, it was in a medium trip like this that Conan, together with God, is said to have persuaded Milei to stand in the presidential election in the first place.<br>Milei has had a verbal spat with Pope Francis, who is also from Argentina. He has called the Pope a &quot;disgusting leftist&quot; and accused him of consorting with &quot;communist murderers&quot;. Something for which he later apologized.<br>There has been much speculation about the relationship with sister Karina in Argentina. Politicians usually don&#39;t bother to comment on these types of issues, but in direct connection with the election last winter, Javier Milei took to social media with a denial: That he does not have a sexual relationship with his own sister.<br>Purely in terms of appearance, Milei stands out. His well-grown sideburns bring to mind the superhero Wolverine. He himself has said that he never does his hair, but rather sticks his head out the car window on the way to work in the morning and lets the wind do the trick.<br>Milei is behind several controversial proposals. Among other things, he wants to ban abortion again, which became legal in Argentina only four years ago, and has opened up to allow organ sales.&quot;<br><br>I wont even bother to say what I think I just copy pasted some information, people should read a lot and analyse a lot before believing everything people tell them specially when so well put like he did...if people used more their skepticism many conflicts during history til today could have been avoided.<br>Only thing I will say thou about the topic of abortion, everyone deserves the freedom to dicide what to do with their bodies, abortion should be anyones right and religion should stay the hell out of it, for accident, rape, due to complications for the mother or baby, or even if you realise you cant give it a good life, so many children forced into the world due to this bullshit agaisnt abortion that suffer a lot during their lives if not all, die early or before being born...<br>So many of those children who turn out to be bad members of society (violent, criminals etc), if anything you know what you should focus your attention?

But the biggest critic of free market is monopoly and wealth unbalance. As well as corruption it can lead to. He only adresses it by saying he is against corrupt people and that dismantling monopoly will make things worse. This is a bit weak of an argument to me, even if we can praise him for wanting to fight corrupt people (could be a lie though, because they both want the same politics). He never adresses wealth unbalance, implying his system will fix it by itself. But this is wrong because unregulated markets automatically creates wealth unbalance, because it is based on the rule of the strongest, and people that draw the shortest stick will not have enough income to fulfill all their basic needs. People overall will have higher income, but the poorer will have the &quot;freedom&quot; to pay for everything at a higher price, and the &quot;freedom&quot; to chose between paying their bills OR go to a doctor. They will have the &quot;freedom&quot; to go to a doctor...if they go in debt, making their issues long-term worse. Cherry on the cake, this category of people will actually work the most essential jobs and harder ones.

My question is how will it do so and how will we ensure that doubling world GDP will benefit everyone. It so often seems that the majority of the increases in wealth are retained in the hands of a few people. Multi-billion dollar companies like Amazon generate massive wealth for the small number owners and top leadership and very little for the large numbers of wage earners. By all means show me. I am not taken by any ideological system of thought. I go to work almost every day and what i see is huge rewards for business owners, top leadership, and investors, and small rewards for wage earners many of whom have large debts. I dont know what the answer is but, i dont see a bright future for the majority of the wage earners i work with. By all means, please explain to me how this will actually benefit people other than the already wealthy? This is not a complaint it is an actual question.

It is the interconnecting of most economies of the world. In fact, to make it short, one tries to produce goods at places where it is the cheapest. Hence, the whole world serves as a common market where everyone is in competition against each other to provide the cheapest prices for goods, so that other international customers will choose to buy in your country.<br><br>But the fact is that the West pushed hard to establish for full-blown globalization because it would serve the West the most. And the West almost achieved it. Had there not be the fact that China and Russia rebelled after 2014 and decided to not follow the ‚ÄúRules-Based International Order‚Äù any longer, we would most likely sit in a fully globalized world nowadays. But China decided to establish its own vision of an NWO and globalization, and Russia as well. That led to major disruptions, after 2018, in the global supply chains and after the ‚ÄúCorona Years‚Äù to the death of the globalization.<br><br>Now take this into consideration. If the West had succeeded with its plan to divide Russia and gain access to all of Russia‚Äôs resources, China would have folded instantly. There have been four attempts to achieve this:<br><br>1) Napoleon.<br><br>2) Hitler.<br><br>3) Yeltsin, who enabled the Western effort to dismember Russia in the 1990s. The West tried that by inserting, training, and supplying Islamic terrorists in Russia‚Äôs Caucasus regions. This ongoing process was stopped and reverted when Vladimir Putin became President.<br><br>4) Ongoing efforts to turn around Russian allies located near Russia and to bring them into NATO. This involved terrorizing Russian populations in these former Soviet countries to a) induce Russia to attack them and b) to bring protest and conflict into Russia because of perceived weak Russian leadership. This would trigger large scale protests which would have been taken over as soon as success was in sight by pre-placed Western-trained puppet protest leaders. And then, doing again the same as was done with Yeltsin. Fighting bloody civil wars all across Russia and thereby making Russia fall apart.<br><br>That has been essentially the Western goal for at least 250 years. In fact, far longer, but my explanations started 250 years ago. If Russia and China folded or fell apart, the West would become the sole ruler over the whole world, since it would control almost all of the resources and markets and also be the unchallenged military power. This would usher in the New World Order, or the ‚ÄúRules-Based International Order‚Äù. Now you might assume that the United States would lead this new world order. That‚Äôs entirely wrong. Never forget, especially if you are an American: Your only role in this scheme is to provide the military force to achieve the creation of the NWO, and afterwards to act as some kind of police force, when individual countries (Libya? Yugoslavia? Syria? etc.) decide to not follow the ‚ÄúRules-Based International Order‚Äù (RBIO).<br><br>The Dynasties that control the finance system and the MIC, which are both hierarchically above the national governments, would use pre-established organizations to make themselves the undisputed rulers of some kind of world government. Which would have been the UN if Russia and China would have fallen.",since the fall of the soviet union something called globalization spread all over the world it is the interconnecting of most economies of the world in fact to make it short one tries to produce goods at places where it is the cheapest hence the whole world serves as a common market where everyone is in competition against each other to provide the cheapest prices for goods so that other international customers will choose to buy in your countrybut the fact is that the west pushed hard to establish for fullblown globalization because it would serve the west the most and the west almost achieved it had there not be the fact that china and russia rebelled after 2014 and decided to not follow the rulesbased international order any longer we would most likely sit in a fully globalized world nowadays but china decided to establish its own vision of an nwo and globalization and russia as well that led to major disruptions after 2018 in the global supply chains and after the corona years to the death of the globalizationnow take this into consideration if the west had succeeded with its plan to divide russia and gain access to all of russias resources china would have folded instantly there have been four attempts to achieve this1 napoleon2 hitler3 yeltsin who enabled the western effort to dismember russia in the 1990s the west tried that by inserting training and supplying islamic terrorists in russias caucasus regions this ongoing process was stopped and reverted when vladimir putin became president4 ongoing efforts to turn around russian allies located near russia and to bring them into nato this involved terrorizing russian populations in these former soviet countries to a induce russia to attack them and b to bring protest and conflict into russia because of perceived weak russian leadership this would trigger large scale protests which would have been taken over as soon as success was in sight by preplaced westerntrained puppet protest leaders and then doing again the same as was done with yeltsin fighting bloody civil wars all across russia and thereby making russia fall apartthat has been essentially the western goal for at least 250 years in fact far longer but my explanations started 250 years ago if russia and china folded or fell apart the west would become the sole ruler over the whole world since it would control almost all of the resources and markets and also be the unchallenged military power this would usher in the new world order or the rulesbased international order now you might assume that the united states would lead this new world order thats entirely wrong never forget especially if you are an american your only role in this scheme is to provide the military force to achieve the creation of the nwo and afterwards to act as some kind of police force when individual countries libya yugoslavia syria etc decide to not follow the rulesbased international order rbiothe dynasties that control the finance system and the mic which are both hierarchically above the national governments would use preestablished organizations to make themselves the undisputed rulers of some kind of world government which would have been the un if russia and china would have fallen,3244,Negative

Within a few short generations we&#39;ll have some weird, non-nutritious white fish that has nearly ZERO benefits to eat.  Might as well skip the process and just eat corn.

Analysts who stay stuck in the financial only number NEVER seem to consider the bigger picture.  <br><br>Now, I&#39;m not saying that brutal, authoritarian Communism is the answer.  It&#39;s not.  But, we need a NEW system.  We need a system that does NOT waste, yet rewards innovation for sustainability.  Like with Capitalism, it causes companies to make things that BREAK often.  Because then people need to buy more.  This is WHY Capitalism is NOT sustainable.  Because we&#39;re just throwing stuff away for the purpose of making profits &quot;LOOK&quot; good on paper for awhile longer.  But the longer it goes on, the more unrecoverable this crap will be.  <br><br>Also, none of these VERY FEW points get into major financial inequality.

He is miles ahead of his western colleagues in this regard. As a libertarian leaning guy I would certainly vote for him. I do however see some flaws in his argument particularly on abortion. Also other social aspects than economics have to be considered in legislation. I for example have a counterpoint to the The libertarian argument against redistributing wealth  &quot;as it hurts overall economic growth&quot;. While it&#39;s true in a vacuum redistributing wealth results in everyone just becoming less rich than they could have been as growth will slow down and the cake becomes smaller.  There is one interesting social aspect this economic idea ignores. And that is: it is well documented that as inequality increase so does crime. The causality can be argued, but psychologically it makes sense that those who are the least fortunate in life will always envy those who have more than them. If someone is working their ass of 10 hours a day on minimal wage and they see someone sitting on his chair making 10000x what you make doing basically nothing, then no amount of free market theory will hinder a deep feeling of inequality and potential anger. When enough people are affected by this anger they will riot and/or ellect radical pro government politicians and thus hurt the economy. Therefore it is my belief that there is a sweet spot where you redistribute just enough wealth so that people don&#39;t become angry but at the same time allow for economic growth to take place. I know this may be immoral according to pure libertarians but I think in the real world it is necessary as the end result will be more government either way.  A pure anarco capitalist society only works if everyone one understands and 100% agrees with its premise, otherwise it&#39;s doomed to fail as the plebians will inevitably rebel against the system.",holy shit a prime minister capable of arguing intellectually sound or at the very least interesting ideas in a long speech format he is miles ahead of his western colleagues in this regard as a libertarian leaning guy i would certainly vote for him i do however see some flaws in his argument particularly on abortion also other social aspects than economics have to be considered in legislation i for example have a counterpoint to the the libertarian argument against redistributing wealth  as it hurts overall economic growth while its true in a vacuum redistributing wealth results in everyone just becoming less rich than they could have been as growth will slow down and the cake becomes smaller  there is one interesting social aspect this economic idea ignores and that is it is well documented that as inequality increase so does crime the causality can be argued but psychologically it makes sense that those who are the least fortunate in life will always envy those who have more than them if someone is working their ass of 10 hours a day on minimal wage and they see someone sitting on his chair making 10000x what you make doing basically nothing then no amount of free market theory will hinder a deep feeling of inequality and potential anger when enough people are affected by this anger they will riot andor ellect radical pro government politicians and thus hurt the economy therefore it is my belief that there is a sweet spot where you redistribute just enough wealth so that people dont become angry but at the same time allow for economic growth to take place i know this may be immoral according to pure libertarians but i think in the real world it is necessary as the end result will be more government either way  a pure anarco capitalist society only works if everyone one understands and 100 agrees with its premise otherwise its doomed to fail as the plebians will inevitably rebel against the system,1931,Negative

@Firelech,2024-01-21 09:09:00+00:00,2024-01-21 09:09:00+00:00,0.0,"There is nothing new in this speech because it is a standard, intellectually barren, demagogic, self serving, faulty justification of a system of social production that relies on the physical and intellectual labour of the vast majority to produce goods, advance the productive forces through technology, mitigate problematic environmental outcomes, reproduce, educate and sustain the labour force, sustain health, protect the weak and elderly, provide necessary but unprofitable infrastructure, etc.  that system is capitalism, whether it‚Äôs slightly modified by humanitarian concerns such as public healthcare for example or whether it it‚Äôs closer to (in reality never extant) his more sociopathic ideal of totalitarian free market capitalism.  In contrast to the social nature of production, capitalism places command of production and allocation of its product in individual hands.  The social production is therefore directed and used for the selfish accumulation of vast social wealth in private hands, far beyond any rational accounting of the contribution of that class of people.  Anyone remotely acquainted with historical development understands that capitalism was a dynamic force for social development because it better suited social production than the decaying feudal system that came before it.  Capitalism is not freedom from the state.  It has always relied on state enforcement, coercion of society into conforming with the control and embezzlement of socially produced wealth.  It is well known that the state itself arose as a means to enforce private control of social wealth.  That is exactly what it did when it smashed and enslaved free societies of the indigenous across the globe during colonialism.  His main premise that socialism is repugnant to freedom because it entails enforcement of distribution of social wealth into social hands is nonsense because capitalism itself depends on state coercion, always.  Capitalism always relies on the state to also allocate whatever share of resources remain in public hands to facilitate private enrichment opportunities.  Clearly he resents the fact that the majority of society have managed to influence the state to some degree to provide some improvement of conditions for the producing masses.  The governments he is attacking are completely capitalist governments but mitigated by social gains won in struggle by the producing class.  To large degree they were able to do that due to the competing example of actual socialist governments.  Capitalists always rely on social welfare and only improve societal conditions when forced to by the masses in political struggle.  Argentina has been held back by what is now quite obviously an outdated irrational and harmful system of production and wealth allocation.  As an extremist and a fantasist he blames disarray on the sporadic ability of the producing masses to win some social concessions through the state whereas in fact the development of the economy is held back by the self serving sociopathic capitalist class that maintains fundamental control over the state and therefore its protection of their parasitic enrichment that is simply enforced diversion of social wealth to private hands.  His resentment of women‚Äôs reproductive choice and environmental management are a blatantly selfish fantasy relating to the social position he and his class are in.  Their greedy state enforced position is reflected in his moral fantasy that it somehow represents the essence of man.  The decay of western capitalism is exemplified in the social decay, hampered productivity, bloated scale of non productive financial swindles and general decline we see in the US as its empire crumbles.  Whereas countries such as China use elements of capitalism that still play a role in developing social production within overarching social control of social production and wealth distribution that is protected by the state.  His rule in Argentina will enrich his class while snatching back concessions.  It will cause chaos and resentment until it falls in disarray to those who will attempt to repair the damage.",there is nothing new in this speech because it is a standard intellectually barren demagogic self serving faulty justification of a system of social production that relies on the physical and intellectual labour of the vast majority to produce goods advance the productive forces through technology mitigate problematic environmental outcomes reproduce educate and sustain the labour force sustain health protect the weak and elderly provide necessary but unprofitable infrastructure etc  that system is capitalism whether its slightly modified by humanitarian concerns such as public healthcare for example or whether it its closer to in reality never extant his more sociopathic ideal of totalitarian free market capitalism  in contrast to the social nature of production capitalism places command of production and allocation of its product in individual hands  the social production is therefore directed and used for the selfish accumulation of vast social wealth in private hands far beyond any rational accounting of the contribution of that class of people  anyone remotely acquainted with historical development understands that capitalism was a dynamic force for social development because it better suited social production than the decaying feudal system that came before it  capitalism is not freedom from the state  it has always relied on state enforcement coercion of society into conforming with the control and embezzlement of socially produced wealth  it is well known that the state itself arose as a means to enforce private control of social wealth  that is exactly what it did when it smashed and enslaved free societies of the indigenous across the globe during colonialism  his main premise that socialism is repugnant to freedom because it entails enforcement of distribution of social wealth into social hands is nonsense because capitalism itself depends on state coercion always  capitalism always relies on the state to also allocate whatever share of resources remain in public hands to facilitate private enrichment opportunities  clearly he resents the fact that the majority of society have managed to influence the state to some degree to provide some improvement of conditions for the producing masses  the governments he is attacking are completely capitalist governments but mitigated by social gains won in struggle by the producing class  to large degree they were able to do that due to the competing example of actual socialist governments  capitalists always rely on social welfare and only improve societal conditions when forced to by the masses in political struggle  argentina has been held back by what is now quite obviously an outdated irrational and harmful system of production and wealth allocation  as an extremist and a fantasist he blames disarray on the sporadic ability of the producing masses to win some social concessions through the state whereas in fact the development of the economy is held back by the self serving sociopathic capitalist class that maintains fundamental control over the state and therefore its protection of their parasitic enrichment that is simply enforced diversion of social wealth to private hands  his resentment of womens reproductive choice and environmental management are a blatantly selfish fantasy relating to the social position he and his class are in  their greedy state enforced position is reflected in his moral fantasy that it somehow represents the essence of man  the decay of western capitalism is exemplified in the social decay hampered productivity bloated scale of non productive financial swindles and general decline we see in the us as its empire crumbles  whereas countries such as china use elements of capitalism that still play a role in developing social production within overarching social control of social production and wealth distribution that is protected by the state  his rule in argentina will enrich his class while snatching back concessions  it will cause chaos and resentment until it falls in disarray to those who will attempt to repair the damage,4081,Positive

Some people say things like, it was a failure of the market to deal with such and such a social issue. For example, if someone is born without property in a country where education is not free, then the market will not be a successful medium to guarantee equality of opportunity (not outcome). And, of course, the problem with capitalism as a historical system is that it evolved out of the aristocratic relations of Europe, wherein a segment of the population began from year 1 with great swathes of property, and others were simultaneously disenfranchised through enclosure and sent to factories where the wages were not enough to build up any stable capital. If you continue forward through that story, democracy was only achieved at the beginning of the 20th century, after which time there were two catastrophic wars which reduced most of the continent to poverty, and they have only been climbing out of that state since. Contrary to what president Milei says, standard of living has been dropping in the West since the 1970s when calculated by purchasing power of the general population.<br><br>I did not write the above to advocate socialism or to claim that I have &quot;debunked&quot; the above speech, but only to point out a problem.

Indeed, capitalism has been a powerful engine for innovation and wealth creation, but its unchecked form can lead to significant social and environmental issues.<br><br>One stark example is the historical exploitation of labor, epitomized by events like the Coal Wars in the United States. During the early 20th century, coal miners faced incredibly harsh working conditions, low pay, and the constant threat of injury or death. Their efforts to unionize and strike for better conditions were often met with violent responses, including interventions by the National Guard. Such incidents underscore the potential for capitalism to exploit workers when devoid of strong labor protections and regulations.<br><br>Environmental impact is another critical area of concern. The pursuit of profit in capitalist systems can, and often does, lead to environmental degradation. This is evident in the contrast between industrialized and non-industrialized cultures. For instance, the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest, driven by the capitalist motives of logging, agriculture, and mining, starkly contrasts with the sustainable practices of indigenous communities who have lived in harmony with their environment for centuries. The current climate crisis, largely fueled by the carbon emissions of industrialized nations, is a testament to the environmental cost of unregulated industrial activity.<br><br>Moreover, the issue of social inequality is an inherent risk in capitalist systems. While capitalism can generate immense wealth, this wealth is often unevenly distributed, leading to significant disparities. The growing gap between the richest and the poorest, both within countries and globally, raises questions about the social sustainability of current economic models.<br><br>While capitalism has been a driving force in creating modern prosperity, its unregulated form can lead to labor exploitation, environmental destruction, and social inequality. These challenges highlight the necessity of thoughtful regulation and the implementation of policies that ensure economic growth does not come at the expense of human welfare and environmental sustainability. The goal should be to strike a balance where the dynamism of capitalism is harnessed, but its excesses are curbed, ensuring a fair and sustainable future for all.",while the speech compellingly outlines the successes of capitalism particularly in driving economic growth and reducing global poverty its crucial to also recognize the systems limitations and the potential consequences of unregulated capitalism indeed capitalism has been a powerful engine for innovation and wealth creation but its unchecked form can lead to significant social and environmental issuesone stark example is the historical exploitation of labor epitomized by events like the coal wars in the united states during the early 20th century coal miners faced incredibly harsh working conditions low pay and the constant threat of injury or death their efforts to unionize and strike for better conditions were often met with violent responses including interventions by the national guard such incidents underscore the potential for capitalism to exploit workers when devoid of strong labor protections and regulationsenvironmental impact is another critical area of concern the pursuit of profit in capitalist systems can and often does lead to environmental degradation this is evident in the contrast between industrialized and nonindustrialized cultures for instance the deforestation of the amazon rainforest driven by the capitalist motives of logging agriculture and mining starkly contrasts with the sustainable practices of indigenous communities who have lived in harmony with their environment for centuries the current climate crisis largely fueled by the carbon emissions of industrialized nations is a testament to the environmental cost of unregulated industrial activitymoreover the issue of social inequality is an inherent risk in capitalist systems while capitalism can generate immense wealth this wealth is often unevenly distributed leading to significant disparities the growing gap between the richest and the poorest both within countries and globally raises questions about the social sustainability of current economic modelswhile capitalism has been a driving force in creating modern prosperity its unregulated form can lead to labor exploitation environmental destruction and social inequality these challenges highlight the necessity of thoughtful regulation and the implementation of policies that ensure economic growth does not come at the expense of human welfare and environmental sustainability the goal should be to strike a balance where the dynamism of capitalism is harnessed but its excesses are curbed ensuring a fair and sustainable future for all,2511,Positive

This is the speech that the pirates will make just before picking your pockets and throwing you overboard to the sharks.<br><br>Milei uses gross generalities such as comparing abortion rights to a socialist form of population control, positioning all competing political groups/philosophies as parasitic soul sucking bureaucrats compared to his vision of a benevolent and perfect meritocracy of idealistic entrepreneurs. This is reminiscent of Ayn Rand‚Äôs juvenile nonsense. <br><br>Consider the absolutely critical inflection point the 2024 election represents. We are in the early stages of the four biggest societal transformations we‚Äôve ever experienced: transportation, energy, labor and food (Hat tip: Adam Dorr‚Äôs ‚ÄúBrighter‚Äù). As we go through these transitions our society will necessarily go through some very difficult times as we are forced to abandon old ways of managing ourselves and adopt innovative --- and previously unacceptable --- new ways forward.

Get engaged, vote, run for office and make changes within our system.<br><br>On the other side of the aisle is the GOP, which has completely transformed into MAGA. Of which their bench is one person wide and deep. And his intended legislative positions and historical record are literally the opposite of all the evidence and positions mentioned above.

To begin with, he&#39;s a staunch supporter of Israel, a murderous, oppressive, racist State, currently executing one of the most horrific genocides in modern history. So one has to wonder how that jives with the libertarian ideas he so boldly proclaims. He&#39;s also closely linked to and sponsored by the Jewish Orthodox Jabad-Lubavitch organization that was recently in the news for some serious incidents involving secret tunnels at its headquarters in New York, with some very bizarre ramifications. In fact, he traveled there and visited said headquarters less than a month back.<br>It&#39;s fairly easy to make bold speeches decrying collectivism. Unfortunately, actions speak louder than words. Milei is not what he&#39;s made himself out to be. He recently issued what has been termed as a mega-decree, which is virtually tantamount to a full-fledged constitutional reform that would give the Executive full powers to do pretty much whatever it wants. This decree has yet to go through Congress, which is under the opposition‚Äôs control, but in Argentina that‚Äôs nothing that can‚Äôt be easily fixed with a few bribes. However, he might have to make some concessions in order to allow the opposition to save face. The decree includes one obscure article whereby the president is given the power to &#39;invite&#39; foreign military forces to conduct operations on Argentinean territory. No mention is made of what forces those might be, what the actual scope of their operations would be, or how long they would be allowed to operate on Argentinean soil. So, again, how is that consistent with less obtrusive governance and individual freedom, not to mention that it raises some serious questions about the man&#39;s allegiance. Bear in mind that Argentina has the third largest Jewish community in the world, and Patagonia was one of the locations considered by early Zionist leaders for the establishment of the State of Israel. Today, it stands virtually defenseless, as Argentina&#39;s military has been scaled down to operational unviability. To make matters worse, it is very scarcely populated. <br>So please, dig deeper, question, research. Don&#39;t be fooled by eloquent speeches.

Capitalism leads to the rich growing richer and the poor growing poorer.  Eventually, rich people will own the whole world if you give them the freedom to own everything and enslave everyone.  Rich people live like kings and queens and will never give up their wealth and power.  Rich people will kill as many people as needed to maintain their power over the world, and many more as needed to make an example of you so you don&#39;t forget and overstep your bound.  Rich people wants to brainwash the mass to believe that capitalism and freedom goes hand in hand, but that is to brainwash you to continue to support the current Western society so that rich people can continue to get even richer until they own the whole world and have everyone enslaved.  If freedom and democracy exists in a capitalist society, that would mean that the people voted to be poor and enslaved by the rich and that people gave away their freedom as slaves while the rich has unlimited freedom to enslave everyone.  Nobody voted to be slaves and nobody voted for the few rich people to have all the freedom to enslave the rest of the people.  The rich uses fear tactics to get people to support the current capitalist system.  The people are so brainwashed by the ideas of democracy and freedom and the fear of being enslaved and losing democracy and freedom that they can&#39;t even see that they are brainwashed into supporting their own enslavement.  Milei is spreading the same propaganda to his people, who are very ignorant of the world, so they naturally believe any propaganda of freedom, democracy, and capitalism.  If Americans fall for the same propaganda of democracy, freedom, and capitalism, it is very easy to see how the rest of the world can easily be brainwashed to support capitalism when it is falsely associated with democracy and freedom.  When you have freedom and democracy, you would vote for communism, not capitalism, because communism is about having a fair system that helps everyone equally.  Capitalism pretends to be the system that helps everyone equally, but in practice, it helps the top elites at the expense of the people.  You can observe capitalism in America operating.  The rich is getting richer and the poor getting poorer.  The USA starts one war after another to siphon government debt into the pockets of the military industrial complex at the expense of American taxpayers.  After the USA destroys a country, it then lends loans for post-war reconstruction of that country.  When those loans are defaulted, the banks then owns those infrastructures and enslaves that country.  This is how the rich elite Americans pillage and enslave the world.  If a country is a communist country, the USA cannot debt trap that country and own that country (e.g., Russia).  By promoting capitalism through propaganda of democracy and freedom, the USA elites can invade, destroy, debt trap, and enslave any country it wants to.  Allies of the USA are just puppets of the USA.  These puppet governments are being bribed by the rich American elites at the expense of their people.  Milei is just another puppet of the USA.  How much is Milei being paid by the USA to sell the souls of his people to the American Devils?",milei talks of freedom and capitalism like he knows what they really are  capitalism leads to the rich growing richer and the poor growing poorer  eventually rich people will own the whole world if you give them the freedom to own everything and enslave everyone  rich people live like kings and queens and will never give up their wealth and power  rich people will kill as many people as needed to maintain their power over the world and many more as needed to make an example of you so you dont forget and overstep your bound  rich people wants to brainwash the mass to believe that capitalism and freedom goes hand in hand but that is to brainwash you to continue to support the current western society so that rich people can continue to get even richer until they own the whole world and have everyone enslaved  if freedom and democracy exists in a capitalist society that would mean that the people voted to be poor and enslaved by the rich and that people gave away their freedom as slaves while the rich has unlimited freedom to enslave everyone  nobody voted to be slaves and nobody voted for the few rich people to have all the freedom to enslave the rest of the people  the rich uses fear tactics to get people to support the current capitalist system  the people are so brainwashed by the ideas of democracy and freedom and the fear of being enslaved and losing democracy and freedom that they cant even see that they are brainwashed into supporting their own enslavement  milei is spreading the same propaganda to his people who are very ignorant of the world so they naturally believe any propaganda of freedom democracy and capitalism  if americans fall for the same propaganda of democracy freedom and capitalism it is very easy to see how the rest of the world can easily be brainwashed to support capitalism when it is falsely associated with democracy and freedom  when you have freedom and democracy you would vote for communism not capitalism because communism is about having a fair system that helps everyone equally  capitalism pretends to be the system that helps everyone equally but in practice it helps the top elites at the expense of the people  you can observe capitalism in america operating  the rich is getting richer and the poor getting poorer  the usa starts one war after another to siphon government debt into the pockets of the military industrial complex at the expense of american taxpayers  after the usa destroys a country it then lends loans for postwar reconstruction of that country  when those loans are defaulted the banks then owns those infrastructures and enslaves that country  this is how the rich elite americans pillage and enslave the world  if a country is a communist country the usa cannot debt trap that country and own that country eg russia  by promoting capitalism through propaganda of democracy and freedom the usa elites can invade destroy debt trap and enslave any country it wants to  allies of the usa are just puppets of the usa  these puppet governments are being bribed by the rich american elites at the expense of their people  milei is just another puppet of the usa  how much is milei being paid by the usa to sell the souls of his people to the american devils,3239,Positive

I will focus on this.<br><br>Capitalism, like all things, is not perfect, and he does not talk about its problems. One of the biggest is cost externalities, in which people not party to a transaction bear a cost. This sounds academic, but it manifests, for example, as mine owners dumping tailings into a river. Drinking water and fishing -- each being forms of natural wealth -- are depleted to save money for the mine owners, perhaps less than is non-consensually extracted from the river users. Protecting against cost externalities is a prime function of governments.<br><br>He also talks about how government should not provide services but instead let services be handled by businesses, since they are more efficient. One problem with this is, what does efficiency look like for a government entity? Take police, for example -- should they make a certain number of arrests to fulfill quotas? Should we have only private police? If you cannot afford private police, do you not get protection or justice? Governments (in democracies) take actions on behalf of citizens as demanded, and all are expected to pay up as appropriate for their economic status.<br><br>He speaks of taxes as a form of coercion. This is true, people with guns will lock you in a cage if you do not pay up. But where is a state without taxation? There are failed states, but these are run by warlords who extract tribute for protection -- taxes by another name. Taxes will ultimately be paid, and in exchange you (ought to) get civilization.<br><br>But let&#39;s say we magically get rid of taxes, and everyone lives without government. Then some people and together and start doing crime. What then? You will need to form you own autodefense group, complete with obligatory contributions in time, material, and money -- taxes again!<br><br>If socialists gain support criticizing capitalism, it&#39;s because they have a point -- many have their wants satisfied while many have their needs neglected. This is a problem libertarians do not acknowledge, capitalism&#39;s price signals do not distinguish between needs and wants: a rich person can buy all the water for their pool while the impoverished go thirsty. <br><br>He talks about capitalism being the greatest mechanism for wealth creation that the world has ever seen, and he talks about ever increasing GDP-per-capita figures, but behind this hides the distribution of that wealth. Who actually has it? Do those without it have enough to survive, to thrive, to challenge the wealthy with better business offerings? An enormous amount of wealth accumulated is coercive in its own right, and balanced only by the collective will of the people -- that is, the rule of law under a democratic government. <br><br>Milei is an extremist borne of extreme circumstances. Extremists are often have a point but are blinded to the flaws of their viewpoint. Just as the communists denigrated humanity for the promise of a utopia, Milei is so repelled by government that he cannot see its purpose.<br><br>I hope that he delivers the shock that Argentina needs to become peaceful and prosperous.

Monopolies can raise prices through manipulation or short term cutthroat pricing which in the long term can hurt consumers. Also the state needs to insure costs are assigned to producers to properly reflect market conditions. Example is making sure oil companies are assigned cost of plastification of the seas and environment as well as carbons released. This can be done through regulations rather than excessive taxation which I agree is counterproductive. Other than those caveats I wholeheartedly agree.,agree with most of the speech except with his defense of monopolies if i got that right monopolies can raise prices through manipulation or short term cutthroat pricing which in the long term can hurt consumers also the state needs to insure costs are assigned to producers to properly reflect market conditions example is making sure oil companies are assigned cost of plastification of the seas and environment as well as carbons released this can be done through regulations rather than excessive taxation which i agree is counterproductive other than those caveats i wholeheartedly agree,591,Positive
