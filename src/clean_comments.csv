heres the original  the ai edited version using heygen 
what an eye opener
this is amazing do not yield to the advance of the state the state is not the solution the state is the problem itself
dont let somebody else pick your friends or your enemies be smart wrong god only offers slavery  wake up gods doing it
he is very mistaken it isnt collectivism being pushed by the unelected selfproclaimed rulers of the globe it is neofeudalism with wannabe elites on top enjoying special treatment and the majority of the worlds population living in poverty
thank you and long live freedom damnit 
bravo 
poor man has no idea
thank god for this man a true leader god protect him snd keep him
free markets with large mega corporations who manipulate government and media to extend their control is exactly opposite of real free market and it is what the world is being controlled by now  blaming socialism for the evils that lie in the third world is preposterous  it is the exploitation of their markets and natural resources by international corporations  and anyone who really believes this drivel that is on this video has to look at nazi germany  yes when you meld corporations with government you get facism and its a very efficient system to deliver comfortable lives for those who cooperate with the system  but goodbye freedom and say hi to a state of fear
duh free market capitalism existed all the way back to year 0  it was communism that developed almost simultaneously with the industrial revolution  marx and engels time was in the heart of the industrial revolution  free markets existed from the earliest times in human history  get over it and face it
hes a shill for the banks
everything hes talking about is outlined in a doctrine of the wef that ive been censored for simply mentioning the name of slocotorp otnorot eht
absolutely beautiful the defense of the free market is wonderful collectivism is equally to mass death and mass use of a police state to control the individual everywhere collectivism has been instituted has created widespread misery
he is honest for the first time ever we have a president such intelligent and decided to fight corruption the unions an politicians highly corrupts are doing everything to overthrow him even when 60 of the population vote for himhe is our only hope to become a civilized nation again
why are the teeth not visible
arent the capitalists funding wef and davos all media that lie to us all pharma giants are payed by capitalism money i mean nice words but the actual fact is that capitalism generated socialism for the little people while they the capitalists enjoy favours and tax cuts from bought politicians look where we are and where we are heading because of this its good that we can solve global warming by imposing greater taxes for the people  and spending trilions of dollars but we cant solve homelesness world hunger or poverty i get the feeling he is talking for freedoms for corporations and not for the little guy he doesnt say anything of use just nice words wrapped at the benefit of capitalist corporations if the state is not the solution then what is corporations wealthy antreprenors its all about the money and with that in the way there is no room for kindness sacrifice altruism caring if there is no money to make maybe the state controlled and payed by corporations is not the solution that i agree
this has to be either fake or cgi as he glitches alot this is not normalis this video even real
screw youtube the propeganda machine
i bet the wef didnt expect this good for him and respect for argentina the wef is going down as the people are waking up so rishi schapps and hunt better get back for the people and get their socialist snouts out of the wef pot
for healing and freedom it will take people like him and trump just to start
what are the values of the western world what are the virtues that guide them
long live freedom dammit
342  a 95 reduction in poverty  the conclusion is obvious far from being the cause of our problems  free market capitalism as an economic system is superior in productive terms        indeed
thank you for speaking up for so many of us we are with you
this ai translation is bs and everything being spoken is pure propaganda
the world needs a cap in capitalism without it an individual can take monopoly and wipe out capitalism itself he who has the money wants all the money
thank you for giving us some hopeall true
everyone in that room is  for the exact opposite which the speaker proposes i cannot help but wonder if this is davoss idea to control the narrative calm people to believe something is being done about this so we wont take matters in our own hands gotta keep our eyes peeled anytime any politician from any country speaks its happened nonstop since the 1950s just keep that in mind
its a about pumping out the units right on
do i not work everyday and still live in poverty without healthcare
monopolies are taking over capitalism it was made illegal for a very good reason that was distroyed in our life time we need to stop those by not reelecting any of those who hold office  we need to drain tue swamp ourselves trump didnt and they will not vote themselves less money  quite the opposite they use their time in office to fill their coffers not to serve the people and havent most of them for a very long time
we need a regulation of both big companies and government blackwater is acting as behind the scenes as our gov they have us in a vice we need to stop supporting any of them
its not capitalism but the desire to make a profit as the cost of people  the blatant disregard of the masses  so they are not doing capitalism for the good of all but for the good of those in power and owners of those companies and their monopoly of the system
he means the demmarats
polarization at the max not socialism vs capitalism there is no curing poverty when we kill our home earth and ourselves there is a solution in the middle we have yet to find propaganda at its finest comments have been filtered out to display only endorsing ones
in his 1980 presidential election campaign ronald reagan famously argued that government is not the solution but the problem lolking at the usa about 40 years later we  see the followingthe  us is the biggest debtor nation the world and guess who owns a major part of that debt  yes it is chinaamong the major economies it is the most unequal country both in terms of income and social mobility where as in africa where according to one donald trump where one finds most of the shho countries  life expentency is iincreasing in significant parts of  the us it has gone down and continues to do soi could go onbut the point is clear watch it the good people of argentina
brilliant speech
there are dozens of cuts and pastes in this speech
he looks like a pissed off frodo
seems some parts were cut out that worries me i like things uncut i manipulated to all me to trust credibility
that was not ai it was some indian guy saying it
boom
the world economic forum already knows everything that is being said here theyre just reeling back their oppressive influences for a while to gain your trust
ph√∂nix hypothese
nugget
fake
is this guy really saying what we want to hear or what i really dont know if its just a show or hes being for real anyway either hes putting on a show for the wef for some gain of his own country or really is putting a genuine truth out there for all of us globally i believe in our god given rights as humans to be individuals and have our own minds and ask questions not this collectivism stuff because ive seen it our past history as humans it destroys us in our minds body and spirit people are brainwashed into thinking they are better off being told what to do how to think how to act etc it just doesnt work economically or in any other status of being a human we were given minds to learn experience explore on this planet but it would be nice if we would stop fighting each other so much and learn to be more compassionate caring and respectful to our fellow humans we can be individuals and work together to be better people for the betterment of our society division because of skin color ethnicity etc is just ignorant because underneath it all we bleed the same color red god help us all
i love this guy
only wish you was a kenyan president
truth is in the middle capitalism is not the best and not the worst today it is cause of deforestation and pollution at large also it doesnt fight poverty or depends on it its manipulative repression its better then communism etc but certainly not the holy grail
wowwowwowwhat a bravedirectspeach
impersonator
best men 
its been a long time since i heard such a ridiculous speech  does anyone have any critical thinking left argentina was doing well with the social policies youd expect to see in scandinavian nations which by the way are doing well in most areas of importance up until 91 then the imf alongside the us dollar comes in winde on to 2001 and the nation was xxxx unregulated unrestricted capitalism is the reason every single nation is in vast debt the problem always with capitalism is eventually you run out of people to exploit resources to rape and other nations riches to steal you need regulation in all essential areas dont listen to numpty wholl leave office far richer than when he came in whilst having  allowed extensive exploitation of that nations vast natural resources you need to remove healthcare education transportation energy legal system politics prison system and other areas of societys core infrastructure out of the capitalist systemplenty of other areas to make fake fiat system profits 
go south american trump go woooo 
truly a man of his time
americas current sitting government is hell bent on taking up down
how come a south american president make a speech which will be perfect for george washington abraham lincoln or john kennedy what happened to united states why united states gave up of all its value milei is right
wow
ignorance at its greatest
just another puppet of elite
yes but we want total control of this planet and we have  so yeah
let me get this right this is a fake adultered computer generated version of a speech the lip movements have been changed to appear as if hes actually speaking in english when in fact he spoke in spanish this is not ai this is bs
amazing a man with brains and courage at last
brilliant  bang on
1000000000000000000 correct only the corrupt and brainwashed could disagree without facts
i wouldnt even give these leaders the benefit of the doubt well intentioned
wow
the west is getting back all the pain they put out the western world is built on the  blood of every nation they destroyed nothing last forever the crazy part is the west is being destroyed by the very hands that built it the west is greed is destroying the west just like the west lust for gold and greed destroyed everyone else countries
read the holy fireskarlakidis is going to change your life you see the truth and feel human
i love this guy
interesting what a warning  god bless 
we need more leaders like him
bswhen your system ends up creating companies too big to fail and govt has to socialize the free market your argument dies
this guy is awesome the problem with socalism is that you are forced to help others while being free and not telling people what to do will cause those same people to help those less fortunate we dont need to be forced to help others or being robbed with taxes and told its going to help others in the country when its used to buy bombs and kill others
brilliant  most knowledgeable economist i have heard since adam smith scottish author of the wealth of nations circa 1776  the 21st century world needs your economic insight and understanding sir  hope others will listen  god bless you
he then cited what he describes as myths regarding capitalism rejecting the idea that the nordic model is socialist and saying that the nordic countries are more promarket than people think he labelled the problem of social inequality as a lying hoax and said that social justice is unfair he concluded that this was a debate about values where socialism embodies envy resentment and coercion while capitalism or liberalism stands for the unrestricted respect for the life project of fellow individualsla charla tedx de milei donde explica la belleza del capitalismoin other words universal healthcare universal education proportional representation as a voting system and large scale collective bargaining for workers are capitalist objectives i cant imagine why hes so avidly against them
he speaks the true
yo biden this is what real leadership looks like
i like this guy he dared to say this in front of the people who are creating the problems
bet hes banned now what a legend though
428 when javier says in the ai version than socialism is altruistic towards others thats not a correct translation what he meant to say is that socialism is altruistic but only because it redistributes as they like to say a fancy word for plain stealing at gun point to pay the poor that keep voting them
hes more american than our president
when survival depends on pure capitalism its no longer survival its cannibalism economic absolutists are just conartists
the problem with deifying free market capitalism is that it is very hard to guarantee free market rulespeople in power often do not have the incentive to make such rulesanother problem is you still need some type of wellfare system if you dont want the elderly and disabled starve
those elites wants to control the people and the world thats the agenda of anti christ
awesome wisdom in this speech
milei what a fucking guy absolutely legendary 
some are worried i should watch my back
argentina says no too davos  period
argentina
this is an awesome speech
his english is excellent much    davosa man that speaks truth too the world
i am sorryi do need to repent too all of youi apologize and hold myself at anyones mercy
truth  your welcome
where is his chainsaw
gtpgts
what he talking about we all lives in capitalism system when all power and money printing in a hands small group of people less than 1 had all resources of 99 and those 9099 lived in a poverty this is a capitalism
love this guy his people found themselves a good one
deep states being defunded
i see a lot of editing  speach skipping the fact that hes gathering with globalist  im shocked to hear him speak opposite from the globalistis this an ai bot whats the gain here motive to calm the massesjesus said deception would be a signtexas border michelle obama on election form election year in usa wars in middle east  americans dying at the hands of iran todaybuyers beware whats coming down the pipethey cant repeat c vidso its got to be more wars and liesstand down  pray for truth to rise from the darkness trump 2024
afuera
wef et al must be outlawed
one to talk this is big mouth thinks he knows everything his country is a model citizen
bravo
aussie here he described our country now 
breaking  every american needs to be aware of this the secret service detail that surrounds and protects president trump has been ordered to not wear a red tie while protecting president trump this is antithetical to their dutys and protocol  let me explainremoving red ties from the secret service agents will make president trump more visible to a assassination attempt from a sniper at long range the removal of red ties from agents that surround and are in close proximity of trump will maxmize the very brief window of opportunity for a an attempt at assassinating president trump we the american people needwhe to ask who ordered agents to not wear red ties while protecting president trump  not only who ordered the agents but where that order came from
incre√≠ble 
biden and canadas president trudeau  are working overtime to destroy our lives 
i wish he does what he says in his country and we see the outcomes as evidencehopefully for the good as an economist i would say extremescapitalismsocialism are not good
totalitarian socialism and marxism have been proven to fail over and over and over finally someone who understands how best to ensure economic freedom to provide the most snd best opportunities for the people to lift themselves out of poverty  free market economic principles are not only superior for generating economic growth and opportunity it is the most moral system that generates the most opportunity for wealth building
brilliant
just to say  bravo bravo
who give him a black eye
if america keeps going down the path its on i will be heading to argentina
god these dictators okay maybe you should fix your country first instead of telling us how to run our business
london and washington have still brain from colonial timenew delhi peking moskva is power todaynew time free palestina
he just fully lied with klaus approval hes gonna do the opposite read this comment again next year
my internet still working stupid title
hes just like us hes different than the others but more than anything hes not boring
we need leaders like this in the uk not rishni sunak
his speech will fall on deaf ears unfortunately
now i am not rich but surely the world is more than about how much bloody money
the spirit of bitcoin no cbdcs 
finally  someone said it 
all he is saying is  and this is to the rich people and leaders keep it as it is because if u go to hard to quick you will lose it all he is worried about what he and them could lose  he was lol saying that we got it good now while how many work daily when life is for living  small small brains see through what they say its us and them and they really dont like us lot  please wake up it is coming
this guy is controlled opposition and if youre too foolish to see it youll believe anything
great speech
fuck the nwo
capitalism is great but needs to be overseen by the proper local governing bodies and not the illegal irswe need to look into all corporations especially governmental with a fine tooth comb and a microscope for criminal behavior go after the certain individuals who take advantage of people and commit financial crimes or theft federal government is corrupt and criminal
amazing speech he will have an accident tor the media elite will now cancel him out of his influential position or fabricate something
historical speech
oh god give us a president like him
he is symbol of poverty corruption lies and hungry
global poverty is just 5 he has clearly not travelled the world and his glasses  impair his ability to look beyond his ivory towers global gdp growth has only helped the top 000001 to accumulate 80 of entire earths wealth
fantastic speech
hes a good one
how would they have known that 95 percent of the worlds population was in poverty in 1800
these are the only types of political leaders who are worthy of their role the rest are wolves in sheeps clothing
fantastic
unfortunately the owners of the large hi tech tycoons corporations will do everything like the old days where 95 of humanity will be powerless they have enough money and resources to restore the old order against all the powerless who still trust politicians and authorities now most young people are naive and live alone they dont see anything except social media and they live in bubbles believing that the biggest problem in the world is gender inequality and voluntarily giving up their freedom perfect slaves because they are voluntary no thought as to who will benefit
bruh dont even look real
er hat die gefahr des sozialismus erkannt wir in deutschland sind gerade mittendrin und st√ºrzen wirtschaftlich gerade in den abgrund hervorragende rede mit weitsicht
he is a controlled opposition
long live freedom damn it
mindfulness ok
this guy isnt saying anything new under the sun hes basically advocating for lessaizfaire economy nostate just businesses so anarchocapitalism its just baffling to me how one can propose such a thing when some big businesses if left unchecked will wreck havoc on the planet the environment society etc like they have for hundreds of years now yes capitalism has taken us far but the system only cares about profit and the accumulation of capital social environmental responsibility isnt written into it thats why there has to be an entity call it the state that handles such inefficiencies yes too much concentrated power on the state is bad but capitalism if left unchecked leads to big monopolies  a few companies taking over on the one hand capitalists say the state is bad because it holds too much power on the other leftistsstatistscollectivists say capitalism is bad because it leads to capital accumulation on a few hands both of them are right problem isnt with capitalism or socialism the problem is with concentrated power we must not let either big businesses get too big buy everything destroy the planet or big governments have too much power drownout businesses spread corruption etc its really sad to not see people try to see things objectively anymore im either bombarded by leftists or anarchocapitalists anyways inequality is at an alltimehigh this guy is just looking at the stats and numbers that he likes and that serve his theory of how anarchocapitalism is great rest of you delighting in the comments saying hes like a hero for spewing neoliberal propaganda why
this speech broke nothing  guys a clown
the truth and nothing but the truth so help him godamen we have been warned once again
is it me or does this look like ai video and sound 
what an inspiration the world over god bless this man
this gentleman did his homework
dont trust noone who speaks at the world economic forum
brilliantly said go argentina
640 todays world is more freer peacefuller and more prosperous than ever before particularly for those countries than respect freedom and individual property rights because free countries are 12x richer than repressed ones javier milei 
the state is the primary problem in america its time to stop all this corruption and propaganda from this great nation god bless us all in jesus christ name i pray  amen may we all be free of dictators and socialism
this gentlemans ideas are those of free market enterprise and libertarianism not so much a capitalist schill
what a wonderful speech
god protect this man  in jesus name amen
go argentina go
people act like socialism is a bad thing you guys are all so tirelesly brainwashed
trump 2024wake up fellow cicitzens
the les battersby of world politics
love this man and the only way to achieve free market capitalism is for every citizen to stop voting stop filing and say no to any type of governmenti am the parakletos
he says the truth
at last  someone coeherent his speech is probably the most importante one this year a magns class
isnt it funny they want to gain our trust as the world has woken up cancel them all trust them not
what a speech you cannot make a clearer case than this the problem with socialism is that eventually you run out of other peoples moneymargaret thatcher
the first person i would vote for as  earths president he would make the perfect first president of the planet
chapeau mr milei
i wonder if robert habeck could deliver or follow up such a speech
el presidente juan bautista alberdi liberal hizo grande argentina a finales de 1800 hoy milei abraza las ideas de alberdi para hacer mi pais grande de nuevo magay viva la libertad carajo
watched up to 4 mins so far firstly i think the initial assumptions are kind of misguided more than anything global gdp increase was stagnant up until 1800s is really saying large scale increase in gpd happened when we departed the gold standard of currency before this time to make more money you had to dig it out of the ground or steal it from someone else after this you just had to print and leverage more from the bank of course the economy grew i would like to see this data offset against inflation
socialism is used right way in nordic countries and successful of it people do not know the difference between socialism and communism
he lied  western puppet
well said
econ master class 
somehow i have a bad feeling about this really someone from the lions lair is talking about banning meat this is either a huge glitch in the matrix or a preplay on companies capitalism taking over all fields of the state socialism i really hope its the 1st
loved it
dont get too excited alt news lovers milei is in israels back pocket and he is backflipping on election promises already in argentina there will be a revolt very soon against him mark my words these so called heroes are fake puppets put out to lead the opposition eg tucker carlson ben shapiro jordan peterson elon musk russel brandwho is married to a rothschild stand alone
we need more courageous and truthful  leaders like you pres javier milei god bless you mightily
so glad people are speaking up against the ridiculous social ideologies these leftist are pushing
is this really happening wonderful to see this
just remember im calling it now he did not commit an epstein
morally desirable no morals in capitalism at all
theyll call you antisemitic for sharing this
intelligent man
facts
free market capitalism wont work in an ai world where theres simply less and less work to do screw this youtuber for the ai voice even if thats useful you still stole his voicegreat speech nonetheless i admire him and his idea but i just cant see pure capitalism working much longer especially today in a world with no morals and mass stealing technology we call ai
this is fake though yeah
thats the only fucking way  the people with the money cant just downsize and equalize wealth distribution 
capitalism is bull shit equality for all is the only way and if anything the people with the money should no longer have it at all
the great reset 
truth it amazes me anyone can debate this
germany in a nutshell
if something seems too good to be true it typically is
amazing the majority of the world sees what is happening but our country turns a blind eye it makes me sad to see our home and freedoms slip between our fingers because of ignorance and greed
now you are talking javier
voy a vivir en argentina
i hope he spoiled the party lol
statisic
javier milei gave up all his political power to the expresident mauricio macri as soon as he could 4 days into power all the former presidents ministers the political cast as he calls them took office displacing mileis own people he betrayed his political supporters in less than a week a total record in argentinian politics
as a side note javier is delusional he is not the one ruling the country he doesnt have his shit together and he will be overthrown sooner than later because hes leading the country into an institutional and political mayhemhes trying to be a rightwing dictator in any way he canpray for us
get bent davos long live argentina
argentina you are lucky to have this new president he will bring argentina to better future
keep your head down mate the us wont like this
this guy is taking aim at the fed market failures and depressions dont occur unless the central banks are messing with the money supply on purpose
i know where im moving if we in the us dont take back control of our values
top speech very very good he really got guts and his to be felicitate he spoke absolute truth 
mili je komicar nista on nece resiti
we in the usa need to have president milei give this speech before both the us senate and the us house of representatives  then maybe government would get out of the way of true progress
the main problem is that the elites control the world and they arent exactly smart just look at the entire biden administration who phizeretc fauci literally admitted in court that he created the virus yet ppl still believe anything else the media has to say instead of that truth then they tried to make the jabs mandated and that corrupted the entire working class now places are still desperate for workers still because of that ignorant socialist mistake hospitals are still suffering by not having enough employeesstaff
government should focus on protecting individual rights life liberty property and ensure equality under the law
absolutely we are at threat i have seen this for a few years now k
he is awesom fk socializm
looks deepfake
check f mate
the wef is trash
what a brave man  he knows that his very life is in danger just for giving this speech
bravo 
i sure pray more people see this
he failed to address some of the reasons why people take on a socialist stance at all rampant corruption in capitalism is the culprit a near perfect system where the needs of a few are met without adhering to the rules capitalism was never designed to be compatible with corruption and it shows at every level of life currently
100 right on the money thanks to javier for his speech
he is a huge zionist that is why he was allowed to say this they intend to make the wef the image of villains so when people like this oppose them they we be accepted by the masses and accept any solution and order provided as a result of this chaos solutions that would never be accepted without the problems that these villains have encouraged and endorsed
he intentionally extorts facts in favor of the capitalism we have to thank scientists and entrepreneurs for living prosperous but pure capitalism leads to the global dominance of large monopolies like faang microsoft starlink etc which squiz the juice of the people forcing them into poverty even in well developed countries
it is clear that socialism in germany is killing it the european powerhouse will die if they dont change in the next 50 years
you guys do know its not a free market right
who asked you to judge socialism you have plenty of problems in argentina focus on corruption criminality and 200400 inflation first
he is talking about history long ago seemingly living in the past we are now moving into a new time a time of ai where its possible that everyone is well off things need to change and this a great time to do it ai is the only tool right now obviously free of tax 
wow i didnt know chudjak was real billions must listen
extreme profit hunger is the main problem in every way they reducing costs using cheaper materials generating more toxic waste and just sink it to achieve more profit raising prices markets want more profit so they raising prices too they say the population damaging the earth so raising prices but in reality the extreme growing profit hunger damaging the earth and the peoples health rich ones want to be more rich and want the other 9999 to be as poor as possible to work hard and make more profit for them its like the car projects e cars arent saving anything just a good buisnes cars only producing about 1 emissions from the global emission rate carbon footprint toxic wastes from li battery producting etc doesnt matter just buy our expensive ecar and burn the old ones if we stop producting of short life scrap and start to make longlasting good stuff the cost would be barely higher if you buy a car and it last 3040 or more yrs with minimal repair it much less carbon or toxic footprint and not just cars in every way we should follow this and we save the world like light bulb cartel waste no matter if it profits electronical devices too they got slow and working badly not because they got weaker or damaged the companies want you to buy new one always see the specs of an old z2 phone which have strength to play 1080p vids good graph games and the internet was fast on it now that hardware cant run messenger  this is the real problem the consumer society
i love him
my internet is still working reported
can someone please summarize is he socialist or something
bravoooo speech of the year
thank you  and now protect this man
the world builds on small businesses  not monopolies
guys he is a puppet dont let them play you he is openly an israeli supporter
down with communists and globalists that took over the west and their governments
how could the liberal milei support elensky an evil director in imprisoning his compatriots is it possible that milei like elensky said one thing but actually did another
how could the liberal milei support zelensky an evil director in imprisoning his compatriots is it possible that milei like zelensky said one thing but actually did another

god bless this man
i could not agree less

i hope his speech weakens the people i like what he says about the government is not the solution the government is the problem  we see it very clearly right now in america 
thank god a man that is not afraid to tell the truth

628 spitting my drink
we the people must stop these sick politicians
boooom  the wef ballon just popped this guy is my hero
fake messiah
i like this guy 
i have watched this video of javier mileis speech at the world economic forum and heres a summary of his main points for those who would rather read it than hear or watch it1 free market capitalism is the only way to end world poverty javier milei argues that free market capitalism has lifted 90 of the worlds population out of poverty and is the only morally desirable system to achieve it he cites the historical data that shows how economic growth has accelerated since the 19th century and that countries with free markets are much richer than those with repressed markets2 socialism is a failed system that leads to poverty and misery javier milei argues that socialism has always and everywhere been a failure and that it is responsible for the deaths of over 100 million people he claims that the main problem with the west today is that it is being undermined by its own leaders who are advocating for socialism3 neoclassical economic theory is flawed and leads to socialism javier milei argues that neoclassical economic theory is based on a flawed model of the market and that this leads to regulations that hinder economic growth and open the door to socialism he claims that the solution to market failures is not more regulation but less4 the west is in danger of embracing socialism javier milei argues that the west is facing a significant threat because its leaders are coopted by a world that inevitably leads to socialism he warns that if the west continues on this path it will condemn itself to poverty and misery5 entrepreneurs are heroes who contribute to society javier milei argues that entrepreneurs are not villains but heroes who create jobs and contribute to the wellbeing of society he encourages entrepreneurs not to be intimidated by the political class and to continue to create wealth6 the moral underpinnings of free market capitalism are superior to those of socialism javier milei claims that free markets incentivize hard work and innovation while socialism rewards idleness and discourages individual achievement7 specific examples of how free markets have lifted people out of poverty are provided javier milei mentions the economic booms in china and india in recent decades and attributes these to their embrace of free market principles8 acknowledging that free markets are not perfect javier milei argues that the benefits of free markets far outweigh the drawbacks and that the best way to address inequality is through economic growth not government redistribution9 javier milei criticizes what he sees as a growing trend of anticapitalism in the west he blames this trend on a number of factors including the rise of social media the decline of traditional institutions and the increasing influence of identity politics10 javier milei concludes with a call to action urging viewers to defend free markets and to fight against the spread of socialism he believes that the future of the west depends on our ability to preserve the principles of individual liberty and economic freedomeven though some details might be missed in this summary i hope that you found it useful
friedman and hayek just cried tears of joy from up in the sky
guy seems like an expert populist speeches are very nice and get attention lets see and follow his actions for the next years i am not enchanted by him like most here
edits every 2 seconds
there is a spanish speech this on in english looks ai to me
its ai approved i
theres something really creepy about him so no thanks
religious and political jewery is our number one problem our nations are being destroyed because of a small group of powerful and influential people  theyve been working for decades to undermine and corrupt all of our institutions   once you realize whats gone on  everything happening today makes sense they see us as christian and want us destroyed     they cry out about history from 2000 years ago we must end the corruption and influence  point out what this group is doing
we fought the wrong enemy in 1939 and for that humanity lost ww2
this man is the true inspiration of the free world let there be 100s of world leaders just like this man of hope god bless and long live javier milei
timely prescient and brilliant to the power of 100
may the  lord god  bless argentina and its new leader president milei
wow such passion
viva la argentina i did an entrepreneurship class as a study abroad program in mendoza many years ago we took classes learning about the economic struggles and crashes they have experienced over the years which were horrific for the people because of a socialist system i love the argentinian people and are so grateful to see that they have such a great leader now given the time i believe he will turn the ship around completely 
as a french i feel comflicte because not only does he say a lot of true things but at the same time our healfcare system allowed everyone to access health products no mather what salary you gain then again its our bills that pay for it the market itself is mostly left untouched so i guess it dosnt count however its true that the state itself has become a problem by having leaders who dont seem to know whats really going on or simply dosnt care then again leading a country dosnt sound easy not at all so overall i support this man i may not 100 aggree with everything but hes trully on a right path wished france had a man like that on top
i hope that at the end of this year milei and trump can meet and our two countries can start a beautiful economic friendship
u cant tell youtube to not recommend wefs channel theyre special comments off every time
tell this to maga who side with putin communism
this is a 
viva argentina
god has a plan for this world and he is never late god bless javier milei
finally one country leader seems sane in this completely derailed world congratulations argentina looks like you have a true character in the saddle
nailed it
fancy words by a globalist puppet regulated capitalism is one thing but this guy favors the monsters of corporate disaster capitalism where the few fewdal techno lords rule while everyone else becomes a slave to the new high tech feudalism
true president
this video has been edited
its the cheap fossil fuels not the economic system
the clip out at 12at a very important point 
 the most important reason for the juggler to put on this show is not just to entertain the audience of course its a subtle gesture and a subtle sign of who we are and the huge difference between us and the jugglers even if its not overtly obviousafter all if the jester has to put on a show it is because there are those he has to entertain so never forget that the charlatan and his appendages are nothing more than a team of jesters and jugglers on stageif you know your true nature and who you really are the charlatan and his appendages also will always know that they are nothing more than a juggler on the a stage
he is 100 percent right
unfortunatelydespite his belief in it deep down he knows that he tells a fairy tail check his bio he is a wef puppet since long before he got to be a president of argentina sold his country like everyone else just with an extra fanfare and illusion of making strps back
queria que o brasil tivesse um javier milei e uma economia bacana
his analysis is so so flawed forget about the causes science  technology breakthrus wars and robbing the continents and slavery just pure time serious analysis and the hockey stick graph 
why did anyone have to listen to this when it is obvious what is taking place you would have to be living under a rock  the real truth is called new world order
the earth is flat
i envy argentina such a president poland would need such a president both my country and the entire european union are going to the dogs
aoc and the democrats should watch this
excellent speech
does he not think all citizens should have equal rights
dont get distracted the main theme of the wef this year is rebuilding trust after all im not trusting all of this
if youre smart you wont take anything that has to do with ai seriously   dont normalize it when it comes to politics  very dangerous
trust me lolololol no mames pto
he was not the only one who pushed back at the wef meeting of creeps  heritage foundation ceo did as well as another told klaus that he and his group at the wef were the problem and to get fkd  these people will not be invited again to speak truth
bla bla bla 
thats the biggest fake and baddest ai switch ever dont believe look at eyes and mouth u see its fake
honestly scandinavia showed it can be done the horrible offspring shown today where big banks can play freely with your money then when they fuck up you foot their bill through increased taxation cause the nation cant afford for the institution to go bankrupt is nothing but greed gone wrong saved by good intentions and fed by hopes of prosperity eternal economical growth is impossible it can only be achieved aslong as someone has little and others hve by comparison more how else would you measure said growth you could theorize it but then the growth is in itself arbitrary
hey i like socialism it did pretty well for germany i bet if europeans became powerhouses like germany back then theyd love it too the problem is the banks
i would vote for this man he has principle and integrity what a breath of fresh air
excellent speech
wheres klaus lol
this guy is on point hell yes finally someone speaks out on the right platform in the right place capitalism is the only way for prosperity socialism is a farce has never worked  never will
has this been edited
incr√≠vel como milei quebrou a internet falando o √≥bvio mas que o povo n√£o quer engolir milei √© incr√≠vel
i mean i think abortion should be allowed at the very least for medical reasons or when the child is the result of a criminal act but otherwise sure ban it as to the other stuff i dont really understand enough about economy to form an actually opinion other than number go up  good things as to the speech itself it was well spoken though i think he could stand to fit in more eye contact and less reading from the script but i get it i dont want to memorize an entire speech either its clear a lot of careful care and thought went into the speech itself
so argentina is gonna become the new tax haven huh also bro sounds like a first year economics student try and have a fully free market economy i fckin dare you dmbss 
people just dont understand that socialism only works on papernot in real life as long as there are greedy selfish people it will never work this is hard truth
someone wrote that speech for him he reads it like he barely understands the words capitalism is the problem watch as argentina falls if its bad now it will be worse if its good now it will be bad argentina will be under the control of privately owned foreign central banks totalitarian capitalism and nothing for the people but debt slavery
i agree with 60 of what this gentlemen states five major wars over the last 224 tears have brought us to  where we are today mass destruction and rebuildingsocialist pushed russia and china out of feudalism into the modern age the west killed millions by over working them and governments did not lead the world by forcing through  modern housing and health programs
my internet still works
by his haircut i can conclude that this dude is not very okay this is not a serious haircut for poeple in such a forum
√©  arrivato il mesias per liberarci  del dominio mondiale grande discurso presidente milei
how can you talk about gdp growth over 800 years ago when the concept didnt even exist living in the dark ages with 90 of exchanges between people being direct commerce not supported by coin or note just people exchanging things they need the bane of this generation is never to find the context of anything
dude looks at imaginary numbers and thinks people are doing better its easy to say that capitalism reduces poverty when you make up what poverty even means thats a ridiculous standard to set any ideology on this man is living in the capitalism of the early 1900s where mega conglomerates were barely an idea in someones greedy little head we dont live in that world anymore every brand is owned by some other company which is owned by another and they decide who can compete and when its delusional to believe that our progress as a human race is because of capitalism we are where we are despite capitalism much of the progress we have made in the modern era has been delayed because something that was groundbreaking wasnt marketed enough or didnt make it to the people who could see its potential how many times could we have leaped forward in an industry but didnt because corporations not only refuse to innovate but become so powerful that they can bury anyone who tries any system run by people will always be flawed be it socialism communism democracy or what have you the only reason there is relative stability is because of the checks and balances we have created not because of the economic system that constantly seeks to overthrow them
this guy makes me feel smart
the only reason to have a gouvernment is socialism free market does not need a gouverment free market entities need gouverment only to guarantee their privileges there was no year zero and so on and so on so basically dude is focusing on rampant growth which we already know is unsustainable and brought much suffering to the working class who was unable to benefit from it for more than a half of time capitalism is a dominant religion and only after long and dehumanising fight majority of people does not need to sleep at ropes and work 18 hours a day and is allowed to bring own watch to work give me a break when you read marx with understanding
this is so fake 
thats a pretty cool use of ai
has anyone done due diligence to check the ai translation or are we just supposed to take this on face value im not even to bring up fact checking but i think its an honest question
he certainly needs to not follow the kennedy family policy of using any form of transport ride horses cross streets in fact he should remain in his house for the rest of his possibly shortened life
top bloke  
this man is speaking the truth to bunch of i pray to god he does not un  alive himself
some ppl complain about global bankers but then work to advance their agendabeware of the 2 faced judas 
so weird the internet seems fine
the world must listen  to this mansanta klaus and his co horts has forgotten hebrews 4 13 16may the sensible world will rise up against all forms of tyranny and injustices brought by the globalist agenda accross all nations let wef the eu and the un and the who the iternational banking  system the vatican bill gates and his allies be held accountable of the sufferings they have incurred to humanity
everyone with a script in front of him can read this ideology script but can he be a president and lift a country out of poverty with this speech after 45 days in the seat milei already has to face mass protest can he last 100 days with this beautiful script
freedom
all true but the wealth hoarding of top 01 is the problem of capitalism
the president of my country 
do you know why capitalists are afraid of communism and convince everyone that it is bad because under communism there are no oligarchs and super rich people they are afraid that they will cease to be kings of the world because all the wealth will belong to the people and all decisions will be made by the people this is communism democracy is the stronghold of communism but you have all been deceived that this is not so
what a decent guy about time somebody spoke truth and common sense wef is a self elected body and is a toxic psychopathic elite who are an existential threat to our liberty and freedoms our very own governments have no rights to liaise with these groups behind the backs of the people the corruption taking place within the corridors of power is unprecedented and we must resist all of these agendas to ensure a better future for our children grandchildren and their future generations i congratulate this decent upstanding man 
javier is an enemy of his country
what about profits made by harming nature witch is a collective good witch also does effect lives to come in future what about money making money by its own aka interest rates etc there are flaws witch cause this discussions
jeez think this speach fails to observe the inevitable inequality free market capitalism causes between those whose privilege allows ownership of production and those without it its easy to talk about binary  notions of  freedom and coercion  when you give a speach with little depth in the arguments being presented economic growth but at what cost
just stopping by to let everyone know my internet is still working it did not break
is it just me or do i see signs of deepfake
the threat faced is the wef and other such meetings not elected by the people 
uncompromising and unquestionable inteligence wrapt up in reality genius
but yeah corporate socialism is fine  we dont talk about that
gee a system based on the premise of infinite growth has had constantly accelerating growth throughout its lifetime who knewlook we can do the capitalism bad communism bad back and forth all day but all i know is that im told that living in the us i shouldnt be miserable yet i am and there are many others that feel the same way i wish i could contribute to society using my skills in a fulfilling way without my disabilies getting in the way the reality of that is that my disability and skills are barely recognized im not capable of climbing the ladder of society on my own but i know i could do amazing things if only i were 20 rungs up i wish i could trust in the products i buy that they have a quality worth their price and are advertised truthfully the reality of that is that i constantly feel like im surrounded by scams and grifts that everything is trying to take a bite of my attention and my walleti wish it felt like i had a say in what happened in my country but all it feels like the people we elect do is lie fill their pockets take more and more rights away and spend our tax money and kill our men in pointless wars im just tired of it all i dont want to be this miserable anymore ive witnessed this system that had been praised fail me and others merely by the circumstances of their birth ive been mocked insulted dismissed downtrodden for things outside of my controlall ive known is this system and people say collectivism is worse fine but something does need to change so whats better
ok at least i know now where to exile if this guy lives longer than a year from now on
as an american i have yet to come to terms with my looking towards buenos aires for true guidance and leadership as opposed to dc here at home  to the casa rosada as opposed to the white house  astonishing to say the least
unfortunately our great country australia has started shipping down this socialist road and again unfortunately we the australian people are so appathetic we are letting it happen before our very eyes
glad argentina elected someone with common sense  why do elected officials even listen to the members of the wef   the wef is what is wrong with the world
i thought about what im going to say for a long time democracy socialism collectivism they all have certain freedoms within the population as far as freedom is concerned and the right of free will for the peoplei have to say that people really dont know how to function effectively as individuals we here in america work for ourselves in the sense that we do it for our families following a government with no real direction there is no real goal for us to reach except the stars which has the potential to unite the world on a journey of discovery and expansion people need to be guided to be given direction to stop being an individual and realize that we are connected we are one
i dont think hell be asked to come back next year
oh rightargentina the country that welcomed nazi war criminals after wwii yeahgreat country
bravo  what a powerful presentation  i pray enough people there actually listened and were moved to change their perspective  the hour is late and if the tide does not turn very soon society is lost
ask yourself this question who invited him to speak and why when will we realize that capitalism has created an inequality of wealth 99 to 1 yes there does need to be a unified dispersal of wealth orchestrated by a godly and holy system that is the torah not the wef
excellent facts these elites need to hear truth theyre drowning in their own ridiculous echo chamber of lies
noticehow parts of his speech are cut and spliced over i wonder why this guy is talking out of his backside how simple he puts it all together i think he thinks were still in 1880
geethanks for thatya fascist
people would live much better without greed which is inherent in a system without regulation
toss in the corruption and corrupt and these numbers can change quick population vs job career ratio jobcareer capitalism made me along with be friendly with people i absolutely couldnt stand high quality nope now its produce crap so you will rebuy    folks hes giving a speach on comparison to other countries the problem is cultures tradition critical thinking       example opposing one subject hispanic males live longer than males in america  the west already sold out
how did they make his lips match in english 
every official that comes in cripples us leaves us maimed silent and tamed  on our flesh and bones he builds his hall ratm
well to believe that our current economical system based on permanent growth works within a closed system and besides sunlight everything is limited in our planetary system therefore its a closed system is not new not surprising but nevertheless wrong to speak about freedom and to mean economical freedom is nothing but a belief in an idea that proved itself wrong already a hundred years agoyou can insist on a ststem that gave birth to the parasitic system of financial economics but in the end you or your offspring will starve and die in the home called earth poisoned by your economic and technical adventures it took this system just 150 years to bring our species to the brink of extinction and we refuse to learn we will go into the history of evolution as the species that existed for the shortest period of time and committed collective suicide in the most effective ways imaginableand no an expensive suit doesnt change this 
wonderful
argentina still the samehe did nothin 
not just translated the lips are synced brief glimpse as he looks up but they also look weird  too much for me
theres no free market capitalism that door has been locked and the key thrown out
nobody sees whats happening this man is part of it all as well  he isnt here to save nobody only god and his son  can do that for us 
i wonder if he chose to fly commercial rather than private  to keep himself safe 
well he started mentioning theology so im out
he sings the song of free capitalism but neglect to mention that that inevitably leads to corporate domination of the world that is exactly what we have now and what wef wants so no this guy is no freedom fighter his country is not a victim of socialism but the very brutal forces of imperialist capitalism
go on maradona
any which way can for him  sound like a new government system
theres a reason why this speech and others of the like break the internet so to speak its because the vast majority of ushumans are not okay with being lied to and oppressed by the tyrannical minority stop wokeism stop cancel culture they are the bigoted bullies to their very core
just facts
lol so fake
truth
what a brave man speaking truth in the midst of snakes if only all headsofstate were as intelligent and patriotic
its about time someone speaks the truth about this
god bless all your efforts for freedom president javier
51k
if population increases then 10 is a lot of people in poverty capitalism is poverty but better than communism
so very well said mr president
im surprised to hear anyone from south america say that free market capitalism works well or is great in my parallel universe the greed and fraudulent activity of a handful of superrich us banks brought many economies in the world to their knees one person went to jail taxpayers bailed out the superrich banks and ceos etc walked away with their massive annual bonuses supposedly performancebased bonuses obviously i am in a topsyturvy land at the top of the faraway tree where uppermiddleclass rightwing dictators and military juntas who were hugely and covertly supported by us operation condor red condor on and very tragically on tortured and disappeared hundreds and thousands of argentinian citizens especially students
nice speech by sbf
well said  i could not agree more
wef got a slap in the face this year 
people dont want to see it probably or simply can not recognize the fact that javier milei is not the enemy of the wef instead of that he is their top boy
wef has lost  they are going down 
lets go brandon
this was freaking awesome i love this guy he saying everything all of us feel he is not afraid to speak his mind we need more people like him that dont take   from anyone funny how all the evil left the room
milei es una de las mejores presidentes del mundo
they will slander and demonize this man to oblivion
imagine if the world could discard the parasite governments we would be among the stars enough we are not woke we are awake
all i hear is truth
the best president javier milei viva la libertad carajo
not only does javier milei look like austin powers but hes as smart as austin powers 
this guys voice sounds very calculated like a ai robot but spot on
god bless this man for standing up for whats just 
people in power dont care about world poverty either js
capitalism is just an excuse politicians are almost always evil
brave speech especially when the tyrants he is talking about are all in the same room
this is precisely the way ai should be used
as a black american i can say some of us have already been living in a socialist system
he indeed should be called brave to explain how bad our country is in a sad sad state thanks to greedy politicians and selling our country to those who want to destroy our freedom
the speech is great but why edit the video and speech it makes it look like its a bunch of bs shouldnt edit a speech
itt should be the new policy of the whole world it factually makes more sense than the wef collectivism globalist agenda
please after you are done in argentina emigrate to america and run for president
i agree the possibility that wef had good intentions for mankind back in the 40s has became an act of terrorism and their science of population control and health a weapon that kills they train their world leaders to corrupt spend put countries on their knees with high inflation while cranking taxes to an unaffordable level for middle class while creating poverty in the middle class and tanking economies by filtering the money out and stockpiling it so it never comes back into the economies of the world  all while pushing an agenda of drugs that kill sterilize takes over the immune system while attacking the lungs and causing diseases in the body that cripple the enjoyment of life while death becomes the end game everything they call the 4th revolution has to do with death even ai as they believe it to be the evolution of mankind rendering up unnecessary
the media made this man out to be madinsane and a joke when he was elected if that the case then we could all do with more mad men like him he who laughs last
best speech ive ever heard come out of the wef
with the greta thunbergs of the world seemingly owning all the air time its very refreshing to have a true voice of the peoplethe parasites of the state should take heed your time of power is coming to an end the more people wake up to the charade being played
i love it long life freedom damn it
anen
argentina still had mask mandates which is socialistdont practice what you preach mr president you should be ashamed
whats missing in the 36 it skipped over something and i have tried several different sources and cant find it
ill bet this is the last time he speaks at the wef
the pathetic to hell  is paved with good intentions
leeeeeeeebirtah 
the evidence us clear human beings are not colonies we are individuals and can cooperate but the state is not able to drive the car it can help build but only on the work of otherssocialism etc systems do not work because of human nature which is designed to be individual and selfaware
say no to the who pandemic health treaty we are running out of timewe are sleep walking into a nightmare
i cant believe a word here i dont trust any ai  this is a sham
forza javier milei  team humanity is winning against evil everyone should support this movement if you cherish ur life family children grand children ur community  ur country its nwo vs we the people 
dont agree in sooo many ways its disgusting  capitalism is one morally superior concept  seriously i was born in soviet union and living in usa for the last 10 years so i have pretty good idea about both socialism and capitalism so i feel like we never gave a chance to socialism cuz it was more like authoritarian cult but some part of the system was absolutely awesome  free education healthcare social services this basic necessities shouldnt be monetized at all it should be provided by default and its totally possible and doable in contrary some parts of capitalism like free trade and entrepreneurial markets are very useful but  again its more like corporate dominance everywhere currently and its soo far away from anything fare or moral its actually opposite of it so if we honest enough to notice that and brave enough to change our ways and combine the best of our experiences we might have a chance
theres great truth in what he said
i hate wef and theres armys of me
is going to broke but argentina
overshoot of planetary limits growing inequalities climate change etc this guy is still living in the 80ies
and there you have it
when any governments talk about the term freedomin a way were all freethat should be a red flag to there citizensfreedom is the exact opposite    on how empires behave and actfreedom is an idea that governments cant encroach on citizens rights
nobody cares  or more accurately nobody in power caresthe only thing that matters is that the people who currently have their hand on the money flow also have their hands on the guns and bombs  as has always has been the caseeverything he said may be true but its all irrelevant as the people who control the money and guns are not giving up a single penny or a single drop of freedom
cant believe he thinks feminism is the cause of all evil and that the free market will cherish for better living conditions delusion
no humans are not created equal if so we would not need the olympics we did not come into existence with the same intelligence wisdom strength endurance flexibility explosiveness ect ect ect  the only thing humans are equal in is human and civil rights how can anybody claim they were created with the same intelligence as albert einstein nikola tesla elon musk ect ect ect the word government means to control the mind so how are we gong to get the entire world to have the save mentality im a combination of a intp and intj ive seen through the design flaws of the us who is the biggest bully in the world
when he says freedom makes me remember william wallace
is he related to benny hill
milei and bukele great example of best presidents around the world by far
1345 pride kills from when a man is lost in own godly imagine this happened before the fall of rome
great speech speaks my mind and soul
socialism is the spirit of evil masquerading as political wisdom fooling the people who dont know better learn to know it better they will burn you so that they might revel in the ashes of their dreams evil
viva javier
outlaw economic sanctions and any economic system could work  corporations pay pennies in the dollar for natural resources of countries that are in the other side of the planet of their home country natural resources should be used for the citizens of that sovereign nation to build their house infrastructure and economy certain countries are poor because countries that built a powerful military go basically around stealing the natural resources for the benefit of their citizens
not a spec of fat in this message and he covered so very much from so very many angles theres more fat in my previous sentence than in his whole 12 minutes
this speech will appeal to critical thinkers not those easily swayed by emotion
canada is the prime example of this our liberal abomination priminister has literally destroyed everything
the us is quickly headed down the path he warns about this man has me wanting to move to argentina 
finally someone has spoken truth at this gathering of evil people
didnt this guy cripple his own market in argentina and now theyre all screwed
finally someone spoke the truth at this horrible gathering of evil
didnt this guy cripple his market in his country and j now all of the people who voted for him have to deal with their own bad decision to vote for him
bravo my respect to argentinians for electing milei  and to think that we have biden at this critical time
we will miss him 
listening to milei in english is surreal but in spanish it is much more entertaining 
we knew this would come
president milei represents the true hope of every man who consides free market doctrine liberal democracy and true individual fredom are the only way human race will overcome self destruction in hands of global neo marxist burocracy onu he is a real character taken form an ayn rand book viva la libertad carajo
what a great man
right to life free liberty
another anti establishment hero trump musk milei rogan the same schame
the world is sick with this politicians be aware
this guy is a pinnacle of humanitys leadership i wish him and argentina to live long and prosper
geez for all you guys who wants to demolish the welfare state you will be the toddlers who cry out loud there displeasure when those involved in a free market do exactly what the free market allows them to do
there is some hope left after all
only 5 of people are in poverty are you joking mate how is this man speaking for people like me  the common man while he sits from his extremely privileged position he makes some good points but he has no clue if he thinks only 5 of people are in poverty
so sad that he wants to kill himself cuz we would really need more clear minded people to speak up to this madness
during his time as a television debater he became known for his aggressive rhetoric and derogatory language milei called her rivals everything from diabolical dwarves to bloodsucking parasitesmilei is a dog lover and on this point there is something to say his former favorite dog conan has his own wikipedia page milei has claimed that he and conan first met in the colosseum in a past life back then 2000 years ago conan was a lion and milei a gladiator but instead of fighting to the death they became best friendsconan has since been cloned and these four clones are all named after economists that milei likes and is inspired byjavier milei often seeks out mediums and claims to be able to communicate with his late dog conan incidentally it was in a medium trip like this that conan together with god is said to have persuaded milei to stand in the presidential election in the first placemilei has had a verbal spat with pope francis who is also from argentina he has called the pope a disgusting leftist and accused him of consorting with communist murderers something for which he later apologizedthere has been much speculation about the relationship with sister karina in argentina politicians usually dont bother to comment on these types of issues but in direct connection with the election last winter javier milei took to social media with a denial that he does not have a sexual relationship with his own sisterpurely in terms of appearance milei stands out his wellgrown sideburns bring to mind the superhero wolverine he himself has said that he never does his hair but rather sticks his head out the car window on the way to work in the morning and lets the wind do the trickmilei is behind several controversial proposals among other things he wants to ban abortion again which became legal in argentina only four years ago and has opened up to allow organ salesi wont even bother to say what i think i just copy pasted some information people should read a lot and analyse a lot before believing everything people tell them specially when so well put like he didif people used more their skepticism many conflicts during history til today could have been avoidedonly thing i will say thou about the topic of abortion everyone deserves the freedom to dicide what to do with their bodies abortion should be anyones right and religion should stay the hell out of it for accident rape due to complications for the mother or baby or even if you realise you cant give it a good life so many children forced into the world due to this bullshit agaisnt abortion that suffer a lot during their lives if not all die early or before being bornso many of those children who turn out to be bad members of society violent criminals etc if anything you know what you should focus your attention not on abortion but on controlled parenting by means of to be a good model responsible parent or not and if not not be allowed to have children if only society would focus on the correct things in a world where many societies have way to many children without any control whatsoeverseeing most of the comments here thou i doubt anyone cares about what i just said and will just consider me a nobody with stupid ideologies  i do believe the world needs a positive change in many fields be it politically financially freedom justice law anti corruption stay away from privatising also since that will be the downfall of middle and lower class if the state is failing its the fault of how it is structured and corruption inside of it  not that it doesnt work
growth for the sake of growth is the philosophy of the cancer cell
basically a succinct summary of austrian economics
the taxation is theft crowd love to tell people they are too selfish to fund welfare and social security
javier milei will be in future history books as one of the great men who challenged the most evil ones on earth
rich want socialism only for themselves for the rest suffer and poverty as we have today in west east want socialsm for teh people who are not in rule of feudal monopoly rich it was always like that west  is not progressive  it is feudal society
i just wanna say how marvellous that ai can be used to translate a person using his own voice
so switched on massive respect to him and i am gonna believe that argentina is on the right path now that they have him in power i will watch argentina happily progress with him
im sure they all hated listening to his brilliant speech 
we are approaching the final battle every preconceived biasednotion towards christianity and religion modern intellectuals and science possess is built upon a fabrication of lies the truth is the most high and his salvation everything else is remnant of canaan babylon and a continuation of their beast system implemented by rome all rebranded as modern day christianity though the truth is out there it exists buried but rejoice  matthew 77 the living word in the beginning was the wordask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto youhold on tight  feel no fear but prepare yourselves peace and love to all eyes reading this message ill meet you in the secret place
ayn rand  author of atlas shrugged warned us  in 1935 about the dangers of collectivism had we only listened
wef is controlled by the devil they allowed a witch to cast her spells on this event the lord jesus christ rebukes you
its fake
long live freedom
this is an incredible lider and great president of argentina  god bless him and argentina 
the people are already living on the street by the millions in the usa   60 of usa are drug addicts  criminals are in the white house the home of evil 
socialismcommunism is slavery
time to move to argentina
ese es mi presidente wachoooooo
i do hope this milei fella is actually a good guy
this voice of reason gives me great hope for the world socialism is the death of the motivated
ai
im sure you know what you can do with your hockey stick  it isnt communism that failed its bad government greed and corruption
this is what djt and normal honest good republicans have been saying for forever
something is a little funny about this video seems glitchy with splices and cuts some of the sound seems digital 
well done to argentina for electing this leader and credit to wef for having him
some of his words cut off
what an interesting so to speak way to think poverty or prosperity are only driven by income so the public services that industry big and small companies and workers take adavantage doesnt matter at all libertarianism is about to respect everyones freedom while the private property its main good is a coercitive method to explote others market cant fails so then the housing bubbles financial crises all those failures had to be either of the state or the reality cool i feel sorry for argentinian people in order to have courage you need to recognize pros and cons of what your dealing to but this man desperately worship the market as the only way to scape of their own contradictions in other words he has no courage but fear thats what defines all his politics
the wef is a sham do as they say not as they do is basically their motto despicable them
i love social experiments cant wait to see where this is going and how long america is willing to fund it
and people wonder why in era where you can see live what is happening on another planet through cameras of machine and different end you can see people batting each other for piece of bread
soon in judgement day may god show us the faces that kept us broke
i have ben  asked to give this message to the elites and the  economic forum thay will use what they have to improve life for all as they were instructed two  you have ben miss using the gifts we have given you and used them in an improper way for your own benefit we warned you  you have one cycle of your seasons to fix this problem or you will be removed   íÄ≠
but when he became president he made a pact with the entire rightwing political caste and they are the ones who govern argentina now this speech as an argentine has no value said by him
  they dont want trump back  oh oh hes coming
good man
this looks ai  his lips move off timing to the rest of gis face
we moors are watching
these words are true
engagement
all the sins of socialism in one speech thanks
wow he has balls he is right about a lot of things though i think he is being naive for lack of a better word when he says there is no such thing as market failure imperfect property rights asymmetric information and imperfect knowledge mean that the market does not by itself internalise all externalities
big words without much substance same for most comments here the nations with the highest standard of living on the planet are the nations with a relatively low gini coefficient and high taxes good healthcare a good educational system good infrastructure all state run and most of the time highly efficient the us healthcare system is not only inefficient it is also extremely expensive its not entrepreneurship which creates big incomes its size even in a diversified exportoriented economy like the one in germany the majority of profits is being raked in by the big often monopoly like corporations the asian tigerstates plus china made their way to the top only by a rigid protective and subsidizing policy reduction of global poverty was manly made possible by communist china one of the strongest economies in recent years was the one on communist vietnam milei is a populist and he has no clue
grazy president  driven argentina  to  its kneel argentina  deserves  much better  than this  clown
he seems he forgot that capitalism only works because of exploitation of other countries and nature and that because of capitalism all countries have the highest debt ever recorded in history and that there is a huge gab between some who have everything and most who have nothing than working 4050 hours a week to serve the state capitalism isnt the answer also not socialism there must come a new system for the market and the people or history will repeat itself and we will have a worldwar that resets everything
hahahaha this guys a salesman and certainly does not have a grip on history his cherry picking off stats should have bells going off for anyone who does have a sense of the lineage of things the history of argentina is such that im definitely not surprised to see a talking head like this at this time
wef our plan is working the people think we did not plan for milei to attack us it is all we need to get our groomed golden calf donald trump reelected he was great for elite spendingdoubled the debt increased government spending 3x debt ceiling increases gun control patriot act and morestop falling for their act sheep
im seeing more and more of these conversations happening at the weo  is this something that has been happening and nothing ever changes  or is it the start of a new and much needed shift 
stay safe
thats that psychopath who cloned and deified his dead dog right
lies over lies
best speech in the world thank you for telling them the truth in their face even if they are the biggest hypocrites and want to keep pushing socialism as their one world order
i spent two years in argentina in the late seventies l saw evidence of a wealthier country that had become less so god bless president milei and argentina
just chatting the shit props to man for speaking outward about those topics
other actors for other parts of plan and we believe is heroes
this guy is an absolute g
nonsense were did you get this nonsense from get real 
he is spot on and a hero in todays world trump is the same
can we make javier prime minister of canada too
the amount of bullshit he said is staggering xd
this man is a lapdog of the wef isra√´l and the united states dont be fooled by him
he is just a globalist clown nothing more
he talks about capitalism but that was years agowe live in a late state capitalism which is no longer super friendly and cherishes prosperity its about power not about advancing humanityits a nice idea but its just an idea holding on to any kind of construct is dangerous as he said we should adapt as soon as possiblebureaucrats sitting in luxurious offices  that was unnecessary and low in the eyes of the local farmers you mr milei are just such a bureaucrat someone is jealous
we need more libertarians in governmentthe us definitely
we are incarnated constantly so we are  caused our own demise
this man rocks the boat listen to this man and you will reap the riches of this system long live free market capitalization down with unaffordable alltuistic communism
socialism and capitalism is the same just that they are masked by the veil that it is communist just look at india its a capitalist country yet equally many in poverty as those in china and infested with scam centres ask yourself why the two biggest country in the world are both communist while the 3rd is capitalist yet all the lower chaste in those countries are still in deep poverty its all nonsense its the people who have the power and wealth but choose to bring hoard even more its not the policy its the so called elites who swear fealty to u know who and all sit around the same table behind closed doors always with the same play democracy vs communism socialist vs capitalist all nonsense its gods children vs the devils servants and we all know who will win in the end
well said sir 
que viva argentina y javierbravo 
currently in the world  we have a big problem with people who run for highest positions in the government it looks like the world is controlled by creatures from not identified flying objects  his speech is very much prove to this 
you blame your own country s going down with a wrong reason it s so funny a poor country lending money to us by giving up his own currency for us dollars words are cheap so mind your  country own business  first and stop teaching the world  perhaps come back again 2 year later if you are still in your presidency
what about the very successful socialdemocracy found in germany 
for those who might be confused by it he doesnt actually have an indian accent
they didnt see that coming
many conservatives have been sharing javier mileis speech at the wef they usually exclude the part where he receives a big round of applause from the attendees or where klaus schwab praises milei for his probusiness policiesthe right was led down the garden path by wefcentric conspiracies which allege the organisation is the head of some kind of communist plot the truth is its an annual ted talks for the global superelite of capitalists who love individualism free trade and western liberal democracy they are not communists and there is no depopulation agenda they do not fear conservatives getting power to lower their taxes and regulations why would they this superelite was empowered under neoliberalism by the same policies of marketisation championed by people like mileiright wing influencers are trying to generate excitement for figures like milei and bring the right back to the low iq reaganism that dominated conservatism up to the early 2010s before trump disrupted it with his rhetorical embrace of protectionism and nationalism the same reaganite conservatives like glenn beck now publish bestselling books exposing the wef agenda with mainstream book publishers the obsession with the wef over the covid period was a nice way for them to repackage the same losing formula conservatives have had for decades as something revolutionary
which software was used for this translation does anyone know
i love third world country leaders telling us what to do 
ah one of the two biggest jokes of the current times ladies and gentlemen the world economic forum
so right and true
brilliant
this is not true unfortunately capitalism is also the acummulation of wealth by an elite and the problem is that wealth can not be created it can only be distributed which means there will always be more poor people in capitalism than rich people and if there are no poor people it probably means that country as enslaved another country for free labour
i wonder when argentinians will address the issues of extreme corruption within their government that led to their downfall blaming everything on socialism is great if every issue was indeed the cause of socialism but it wasnt i dont disagree completely but blaming socialism in argentinas case is a copout
yes unrestricted tell that to the citizens who lived near a dupond plant who died due to unnatural causes  because it was too expensive to manipulate waste properly amazingly those stoped once regulation was in place i wonder why this man is just a hole
can we borrow or clone him   we have trump for 4 years
communism was a mistake along with the births of all those who still support such a failed ideologywe had complete freedom and peace but in a senseless desire to fix our system we forever destroyed it it will take more blood and hell to get it back and its all the fault of those who chose to kneel tocollectivism whilst selling the souls of their future generations to heartless tyrants
coercion it was exactly this capitalism of usa that led real estate agents to hunt for the bonus of sale that led to their crisis
the problem is the  bankers  argentina is a prime example  they got indebted by taking out imf loans they could never pay back  kirchner is part of the banking cabal  they put in their own
another one with the freedom slogan sir no one remembers the second
libertarianisme 
if the state wont have taxes how this man will obtain enough money to get there and talk his stuff
nice theory but he doesnt explain why capitalism does all that but the result to tie the result with one reason there is not enough evidence for the argument to be true
did this guy seriously just try to attribute the sudden increase in gdp per capita in the 1800s to freemarket capitalism instead of industrialization and follow that up by stating with a straight face that there are no market failures and that anywhere there is a perceived one is because the state intervened unjustlyjesus christ neoliberals are sick in the head
amen
looking for a critical comment  this is an attempt this speech sounds very good because he is basically saying that socialism even partially is hindering the free market capitalism with taxes which is true but the biggest critic of free market is monopoly and wealth unbalance as well as corruption it can lead to he only adresses it by saying he is against corrupt people and that dismantling monopoly will make things worse this is a bit weak of an argument to me even if we can praise him for wanting to fight corrupt people could be a lie though because they both want the same politics he never adresses wealth unbalance implying his system will fix it by itself but this is wrong because unregulated markets automatically creates wealth unbalance because it is based on the rule of the strongest and people that draw the shortest stick will not have enough income to fulfill all their basic needs people overall will have higher income but the poorer will have the freedom to pay for everything at a higher price and the freedom to chose between paying their bills or go to a doctor they will have the freedom to go to a doctorif they go in debt making their issues longterm worse cherry on the cake this category of people will actually work the most essential jobs and harder ones this cycle of chaos will keep going as long as the population is high enough because the system can always replace the broken people who will get sick and die sooner ah isnt nature great but this is all okay for him because he does not value all human beings the same he also never adresses the weight this system applies to the planet which cannot be denied and will even be more obvious in the next decades infinite growth is not possible in a limited even if abundant environnementsame for feminism he did not say why it is badso whats the solution from here  i am not necessarily advocating for socialism i can understand a lot of stuff he said was true in a way but the complete lack of state and regulations he is advocating for is just an other extreme compared to socialism or communism we dont need ideologies we need casebycase problem solving starting from solving poverty food and health issuessmart stuff was never implemented  what if linked the smallest and highest salary in a company by a factor what if we put money in actual factoryside pollution capture  this could be a new market health should still be mutualised because it is not an indidivualonly issue we can create virtuous circles just by making better laws and regulations we dont need to throw away everything
too bad capitalism doesnt exist only since the 19th century but since the 17th people keep making this mistake of thinking is capitalism that generates wealth it is not technological innovation generated the improvement of conditions not capitalism if anything capitalism when unregulated slow down technological innovation if we take one of the most capitalistic countries in the world the us and look at where their strongest growth period was it was after the new deal where capitalistic practices had to be subdued to a stronger state regulations if we take china well not much to be said right the fastest growing economy on earth and they have a mixed system where capitalism is a tool of socialism not the opposite this guy is spreading false information historically wrong and if you believe hes right you need to read more or read better books
when argentina changes then you can speak
deep fake
yea its so long boring  delivered poorly that it broke internet
one of robin williamss finest moments

this is creepy
it is a deep fake people wake up
wow
this is the dude that got elected by talking to his dead dog and then had it cloned right funny how the happiest and riches countries in the world functions the exact opposite of what hes trying to get out aka scandinavia and such
this guy is the establishments biggest asset in south america
nowadays its considered progressive to promote capitalism because the global elites want to pull the world back into feudalism bravo
we need to spread it world wide  media keeps being silence about this point of view pushing bullshit eco agenda or sth
rip argentina
well said
its litterally the wolf that tells the sheep how good it is to roam wild by yourself out of the flock and the shepperd this is absolutely not the way capitalism worksthose politics always talk about progress through the prism of economic growth but this is not how economy workswhat they forget to tell you is that the money you have has value only if others dont have it its a ponzi scheme money is not a finite product generated by people it is the tool used to avoid equalitythe problem is that most people dont know and dont know how the system works and these right liberal movements are capitalizing on this pun intendedthe reality is that nor from capitalism or the current socialism is fair and human they are both power tool for the elitesbecause their only goal is to make sure that we never create or perfect any system where they couldnt stay on top its an on going issue for thousands of years as a french born and raise i can say that every revolution only happenned when at least part of the elite were sure to still be winning on the other of it what we call revolution nowadays wasnt anything else than a putsch a coup when it was indeed to get rid of the sole power of the monarchy they were already prepared to receive it in between nobles and we are still today in this frameworkmoney isnt a tool to quantify freedom nor comfort money is paper and ink it has only the value we attribute to it and in a capitalist system the more we all have and the least it is worth take the case of venezuella 5 to 10 years ago when the countrys economy crashed the issue wasnt the numbers but their value from one day to another the money wasnt worth anything people started fire with thousands of bank notes just to get warm made clothes and hand bag with bank notes because it was cheaper than textilenow socialism and comunism propose that the needs will be covered by the community humanity as a group will carry its all burden and collect the fruits this is an attractive promise but unfortunately as long as we will have sharks in power or anyone in power for that matter this will never workas a great comedianphilosopheractivist saidin the west its true that we are all egual but some of us are more egual than the others  coluche 
i been born and raised in a communist country i know exactly what he talking about he is one hundred percent right
i live in argentina and everything here is worse than before you english speakers dont have an idea of what is happening here he is just a puppet of the bankers and international corporations
lets ask the majority of people of of india bangladesh pakistan haiti and most african countries how unchecked capitalism has worked for them so far
40 of argentinians live in poverty dont believe this crap
thats odd my internet is still working
telling it like it is
we need more men like this one also what is the name of the ai it almost sounds like the guy
canada need you dearly our actual prime minister its the worst it ever been he with his corrupted government 
the mouth of the speaker is digitally manipulated i think this is bogus
he is saying that free market capitalism is the solution to poverty what a nonsense its the cause of poverty
nonsense its capitalism that made argentina poor and the whole world
why is this so highly edited or done by ai
lmao he now sounds like indian guy
but the west as we know it its still fucked up but world leaders are trying to push something thats even worse but dont mistake the west is already fucked but we dont notice it because we believe we are free now its a passive kind of oppression we live in now what they are pushing is oppression that is obvious to everyone
either you follow the path of europe and america that is the path of civilization progress and development or you follow the path of anarchy obscurantism stupidity ignorance hatred in the direction of the caves war of savages against the civilized west
great speech rather refreshing to hear a politician talk the truth like that
well bravo
so he is another wef stooge  good luck argentina  you need it
i know someone who wont be invited to next years wef annual satans little helpers meeting
i might need to move to argentina
wow amazing   
one of the best speeches ive heard in a long time he took the words right out of my mouth 
rip argentina
obama care check it out the obama administration ordered 30000 guillotines what do they need 30000 guillotines for depopulation werent going to wait for us to die of old age ya know
argentina hasnt tried socialism yet that is true socialism after trying fascism neo liberalism social democracy  it seems libertarianism is last throw of the dice it seems to me when capitalism fucks up socialism carries the can but heres the thing capital was self destructing well before socialism emerged in fact the crisis prone capitalist system was why socialism emerged in the first placeinstead of more capitalism argentina should get rid of capitalism  its tried all varieties of capital and theyve all failed so i cant see how even more capitalism can fix anythingsome countries just have to admit theyre not going to enter the first world which above all else is down to location geopolitics or just the happenstance of history the best they can hope for is second world command economy socialism like the warsaw pact or yugoslavia
i like this man
ur forgetting key problems of capitalism monopoly do you like that big companies buy small startups and never use them do you like that game companies do same shitty game every year or so nothing original do you like oil monopoly do you like humans lose jobs due to ai dont mind me im kinda fun of free market but it have own flaws too
we support this guy 
he should not have gone to the forum he should have rejected the invitation i wish argentina and its president great success but davos is not a stop they should have made
nwo
i wish everyone could see this and give it great consideration  such truth spoken here
dont cut bits its annoying
the socialist college students in american universities shiver and is fuming with anger ryt now muh healthcare muh free tuition
wow what a speech this man needs to be listened to 
the problem is the ability to make money out of thin air remove and destroy all forms of interest and voila suddenly capitalism makes sense freedom capitalism and democracy are 3 distinct elements that most people incorrectly assume to be a single entity
this demon is talking nonsense all day long
a brief on basic economics and economic history courtesy of all people the mad man kudos to him for truthing the truth
he reads in english better than some americans a pleasure to listen to  him
this still guys talking the biggest crap off the century i dont think he knows who is high jacking the poor people in the pyramid all those rich people on top of the pyramid exploiting the poor gaddafi was the only leader that that eradicated poverty in libyafree education no tax housing affordability and paid a havy price for his brilliant work check his speech and the united nations
i wish i was there in person so i could know what he  really said but ai can probably alter that too into the microphone through the processor out the pa doom is what i hear who knows what he said such a shame
down with wef
i think dude forgot what led to both world wars
im astonished they invited him to speak and wish he went a little harder on them but very well put 
dont know much about the situation but the last thing i trust here are these smashed together snippets
and he has our support gghf
very interesting and important data
currency or coalcapitalism or combustion
what is he talking about 97 where does he get his facts
wow i love this
this speech provides me with enough hope that it almost makes me not horrified of the capabilities of ai
why is he lecturing on capitalism who wrote the script who profits
i like positivity this man speaks clearly no nonsence just factsa good leader
odd some words were cut out sounded edited not by mistake or audio problems
he is like a trump and tucker mixed
well at least the ai voice does sound like him
god blessu sir
you can cure poverty without economy
this did not break the internet it was boring af
so right on you as an individual are being sifted and separated from socialism and will be the target as the masses who depend on govt assistance and corporate tax breaks taking from you and giving to those who have no respect of work 
an oversight in the invitations
uplifting i love this guy he doesnt mince wordsbetter than the money speech by fernando in atlas shrugged
free market free people collectivism is collective misery
well done argentina for rejecting the evil of socialism
crazy how capitalisms real growth happened when it found china as a work force capitalisms gains are an illusion companies are constantly trying to keep up with growth expectations and eventually it will stagnate then the system will crash were still a ways off from market saturation but once the countries that capitalism uses for cheap labor overcome poverty theyll refuse to do the work for the same price and then where will the labor force come from to keep the growth so investors dont just pull their stocks and collapse all these companies there is a reason almost none of our companies make anything within western borders
all we need is to remove the rules of a corporation that allows it to be seen as a living entity that has all rights of a human entity but none of the responsibilities as soon as thats done the corporation ceos and shareholders will be accountable and responsible and legally at risk for all their evil bullshit its the one thing causing this craziness and undisciplined attack on the tax payers d their employees the governments x love is all from melbourne australia
damn it
if you want to prosper then go east this man talk tough to the country that is helping others enjoy bones from your master bones only
true
the president of argentina told the true god bless you
i believe that guy was the only man in this rotten place
so chinas experiment with the free market economy whilst keeping their  socialist and collectivist values totally failedabject poverty erasedsubstantial middle class homeless people high sense of safety and stability etc etc
lets all take a moment of silence regardless of the message of the video  that this video is evidence that ai has made it impossible to trust anything we see or hear anymore when consuming media 2020 has changed the world into a theater
all systems undergo a clear cycle 1 creation of system 2 system growth 3 system stagnation 4 system abuse 5 system fallall systems become corrupt once human attributes of greed and lust for power take over justice and freedomextreme wealth and power corrupt everything in all systems capitalism socialism communism etc
i love this guy he said so much of the quiet part out loud refreshing to see someone who understands economics socialism and human nature speaking in public without shots fired
he just described the exact goal that the un wef and who along with every proxy sub org that were created to execute this exact agenda have conspired and executed their agenda upon us all and what we know as the source of global suffering and loss is their success at obtaining that exact goal as they enjoy the old ways of 95 in poverty and total indulgence in any pleasure power and wealth and no competition and no prosecution of their corrupt desires and crimes against humanity
can we borrow this good man for about 4 years in america as vp to djt  
hes a rock star 
wow talk about a brave man and someone who loves his country and his people no one a davos cares about their own people they care about themselves and how they can get richer
bla bla bla  argentine is the only country with economic failure we dont need no lecture from a bankrupt country
its called a false dichotomy neither capitalism or socialism is the answer this debate only exists to distract you
amazing ia translator
the world is more peaceful not sure what planet hes referring to 
long live freedom damn it
parab√©ns argentina por ter eleito milei
people who defend socialism especially in wef have private jets and money hidden in tax heavens they want socialism for the rest not for them
how can someone talk against those wordsthis is one of the good guys trying to help the achievement of a better word for all human beens unfortunately there are few guys who dare to oppose the stablishment  and the  powers that be
he drew the line in the sand time to put on the big boy pants or else go home to mommy got your 6 mate
thank you argentina
this is a deep fake  look at his facial gestures
wow  bravo  we hear you  more people like that is needed 
why is he doing a speech with the wef right behind him thats definitely not sus at all looks like another puppet reading from a script given to him by a globalist hes definitely controlled opposition he was waving the globalists flag when he got elected instead of his own countries flag
we need trump badly biden is scaring the world
yes all this is true however it was done with ai to sway this truth
this video is highly edited spliced in a way to mislead
thank you thank you thank you comunism asocialism is slaverylived through it  i survived but now history is repeated by evils
my new hero
bravo  bravo bravo
god bless you sir
austin powers got voted in so cool
then why hasnt any country that went to socialized medicine gone back to a free market system
watch the original because the ai version is missing words
please protect this man who speaks the truth
wow what a speach that was a huge shot fired in the face of evil
i was thinking which country to move to looks like argentina could be an option in 5 years
father knows best 
wow they even know whats up
claus is throwing up in the bathroomfreeland is cleaning up his messtrudeau is madsaging clauses u know
hopefully the sleeping masses will wake up but i doubt it
this is greatness go argentina
o klaus n√£o teve um ataque card√≠ac0 
too bad milei doesnt actually believe in a freemarket capitalism he is just another monopolistic capitalist who uses the freemarket truth as rhetoric to implement his dismantlement of argentinas system for his cronies and his own benefit
my kind of president 
this was historic
absolute facts that cannot be denied
fantastic saying this at davos is really amazing
bravobravo  argentina
well said i wonder if i can migrate to argentinian
awesome
now somebody do something to stop puppet biden his handlers and the invasion at the border
is he talking to 1 about  1
i hope he remains the same person when he returns from there if you know what i mean
thank you mr milei
why is it skipping  was something cut out
this is all extremely correct makes me want to move to argentina
here here thank you
i have no clue why it broke the internet everything he said makes perfect sense its the insaine left thats why it broke the internet because the lefts brains are truly broken
the middle class is a brief divergence from the norm it was an interesting experimentthe world will return to its natural state just 2 classes the very wealthy and the destitute this will be achieved with the support and cooperation of those who will be destitute please everyone continue to be distracted by socialist and communist nonsense and by woke nonsense and by all other emotional issues please everyone continue to vote for politicians who are in the employ of the wealthy because the wealthy loves you and they dont want your money
nice to see little speeches which mean nothing does nothing and wont accomplish anything unless you the citizens of the world finally stand up and say no more
capitalism has been misrepresented it is the only social system that gives everyone a fair chance to be successful and excel all others are oppressive javier knows from experience
we have come full circle the boston tea party and anybody who understands what that was actually about was unfair taxation by a distant overlord making up shit as they wanted without any local representation protests by the colonists where frequently broken up by force and at one point boston was turned into a imperial garrison to stop the rapidly evolving democratic process that simply desired economic freedom fro the east india companies stranglehold and the ability to be consulted when laws are being made by parliament these where by and large proud white british people who loved their king and praised the crown when it made the right choice these where not american rebelsup to that point western freedoms were and currently are built on taking away others freedoms not creating a superior product whatever it may be the people with more guns are in charge its that simple its a ludicrous system that amounts to medieval might makes right where the winner of the war became the next king until they intern were killedfun fact in england at least the conservative party is the establishment party and is run by the aristocrats to keep themselves in power they always vote for more taxes unless the voters are particularly pissed that time this guy is the opposite he understand how economy works he also understand that essentially taxes are the gman coming to your door with a threat pay us for stuff we promise to do but probably wont do or your life is forfitthat is modern corporate fascism and the return of the east india company we have a bunch of old wealthy aristocrats running most of the big companies who have no problem forcing you to purchase shit and fight endless wars for their sole benefit
finally somebody says this out loud respect to this man having been born in the ussr i can relate so much
didnt know he could speak english
what a speech how did wef invite him
well he wont be invited back
its funny how the only ones speaking out against the wef are trying to scapegoat socialism as if it wasnt capitalism that equated money with speech and deemed it acceptable for corporations and billionaires to bribe our politicians the people attending and running the wef are the winners of capitalism attempting to consolidate their power and wealth this is what happens when you allow a few individuals to amass more wealth than entire countries
goodbye aoc bye aoc
finally a leader who speaks the truth well said
this sound ai generated
he is the only good politician now
am amazing speech
looking forward to president trump working with this man
f the wef in god we trustnot in globalist virtue signaling enslaving communist 
mr rounding out the situation with the kirchnerist communist government in 2000 1000 convertibles were 1000 us dollars today in 2024 the value of 1000 is equivalent to 1 us dollar we were already venezuela milei has been in power for 40 days and it is noticeable that it is stopping inflation here the beef is low the state has 4 million public employees and 4 million supported with social plans plus the theft from the public treasury thanks good video hector loprieno
reagan is smiling ear to ear
in fact this character is not for freedom but for slavery you have to listen carefully to what he says and not fall into rhetorical trapsmiley regulating monopolies destroying their profits and destroying growing profitability destroys economic growth that is he argues the meaning of the entire economy lies in the growth of monopolies revenues that is in effect transnational corporations this they say leads to an increase in the welfare of the populationbut both the globalists and the wef promote this very doctrine none of them are against monopolists against corporations they are against medium and small enterprises against farmers etc but not against oil companies pharmaceutical companies etc and they are against states in favour of subordinating states to wholly international organisations funded by transnational corporationsso mileys speeches are fully in line with the wef but naive people think that if he is against socialism and the state he is also against the wef quite the opposite the fact is that the wef the globalists are not for socialism and the state they are for slavery as for example slavery in the east india company or slavery in the third reich concentration camps or slavery in the east india company first empire  in the roman empirein short miley is not for freedom but for slavery
margaret thatcher referring to neoliberalism and finance capitalism said there was no alternative brics led by russia and china think otherwise when he says libertarian he means free reign for the corporations and banks to free themselves from state regulations and do as they please
could someone help explain the rational for a liberty absolutist being against womens liberty with regards to abortion i dont follow the logic

communism equals mass genocide and mass poverty
go argentina
excellent
one way to not end up in the dangerous lines of communism is for a lot of people to stop snorting coca and whatever else if socialism is drinking then a lot of what capitalism is snorting neither should be doing this and they wont see each other as a threat same applies to nationalism

the main problem in the west today is the strong links between government and corporations im sure there is a word for that  begins with f  didnt germany do it 80 odd years ago  didnt an italian dictator call it that 
a lot of you get your information from youtube and it shows lol
the communists of the world are afraid
bs 
no heros here  just greedy narcissists
lifted us out of abject poverty into financial poverty 
im moving to argentina i like his beliefslet vote him in for vice president of usa 
life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
we are all equal im just more equal than you
javier is a wef puppet who is pushing neoliberalism via the corporate takeover and privatization of everything in argentina he is also ushering in a police surveillance state that will undemocratically punish any opposition to his party he is not the leader you all take him for he lied
they have blown it  we all know  now what they are about  where their priorities lie what they think of us 
man this guy is a legend keep going hard
i dont think one speech will change what these people are or are doing unfortunately they will only care about this if they feel that looking  like they care will cement their positionnarcissistic megalomaniacs
excellent speech and absolutely correct if capitalism is bad how then did america the youngest nation become the greatest nation in the history of mankind everyone in the world benefits from american tax dollars even if they dont admit it or recognize the fact if they want to get rid of people to protect the planet then all climate change activists should go first since they are the ones who believe in it and to set a good example for the non believers
what about then countries like denmark where socialism is a great example of success
facts on facts on facts 
false
lol an epic speech of walltowall bullshit aimed at the politically inept hypocritical milei criticizes the rich while simultaneously taking his policy from us based atlas network a collective of far right think tanks aimed at easing the burden on the super rich all at working class peoples expense what a joke he is
what is free because you say we are you never own your home the irs does you dont own anything and your not free
he is promoting capitalism in fact we should run away from all formsisms he says capitalist should be like a hero in their country basically he wants to keep and save status quo i say we should go back to gold  silver money thats it gold is gold any part of the world so your profession is valued equally anywhere in the world no difference in earnings taxation is only collected for the betterment of free education free health care gmo free agriculture for technological innovation and growth for betterment of common peoples lives not for the pockets of politicians not for exploring space and rockets not for military interventions not for wars not for anything that harms the economy of any country and such format of living is based on gods law not based on human produced mandates states decrees legal fictions
troll
i wish the current us president could hold a speech for 19 minutes with out falling or stuttering
finally an intelligent man at the wef
im kinda surprisedmaybe he lives in a different reality than i amwhere is all the prosperity  based on capitalism and where are all the pple who live such a good life because capitalism is morally superior hes a dreamer  which has is not bad  but his dreams are based on other dreams not on the reality of the most pple
why is some parts of the video cut off im confused
w
hello im afree radical in the body of the beast who are you
this guys a hero
if only the issue was so simple in pure capitalist systems the rich capitalists always compromise and capture the political parties resulting in governments that serve the rich it happens all the time
did it really break the internet
ok i dont ear anything else then promoting the capitalist system who is the west not courageous enough to mention the countrys  got paid for this speech   i suppose 
i cant help but wonder if citizens in the west will watch this and think there is a 11 comparison between western and argentinian politics
why all the abrupt edits
great speech but he forgot to account for environmental costs which are just about to grow exponentially and preventing the event will be way cheaper than trying to fight it with libertarianism
at 336 minutes in 90 of the worlds population out of poverty which world   totally incorrect  theres much more 
gdp does not equal welthlook at usa extreme minƒô and extreme poverty like in brazil
cleveland ohio agrees with you
long live freedom dammit indeed
based
argentinian teaching the rest of the world about economics
i am afraid that nobody of those midwits in the audience got what milei was talking about
se o brasil fosse um pais capitalista como os estado unidos n√≥s seriamos como a nig√©ria ou pior
the world for the rich people and fuck the state  you need a structure for society or do the rich get to structure that too
thank you ai for your translation
brilliant speech
god bless argentina
can we just borrow this guy to run the usa for a couple of years  we promise well give him back
its a trap
i must disagree only on the point that national socialism and fascism are variant on their definitions of the collective often defined on a cultural hegemony and not regulatory or economic totalitarianism
the cake is a lie
who is john galt
what a wonderful and refreshing speach thank you sir 
hes forgotten about the muffin man that lives in drury lane 
i dont get how someone who wants less government involvement and less regulations still wants to regulate womens bodies it just doesnt make sense
lol i guess that talk in anartica with the ufp really inspired him  
exactly this man is spot on 
the truth about todays world the western world let the socialism   cancer to overwhelm our society
he nailed it brilliant
ask the capitalism to the workers in the uk who work overtime and wait on nhs waiting lists for years to get seen by a dr socialism all the way speak your own language and dont be a puppet
im a person with mental disability i dont understand what he is trying to say what is his main points in this speech thank you
sounds like california
is this photo shoped i can see pixels at his lips on my 8k screen there are no pixels why does hes lips have pixes
claus schwab probably banned him after this
yes butthe continued exponential growth has busted the planetary boundaries of available resources to sustain even as it is without every increasing growth the global inequality of the few richer nations being very good at grabbing resources cheaply and holding the means to add value to them the military spend to maintain position in the game the multiple biosphere collapses if capitalism has a real social responsibility and was tied to sustainability of resources biodiversity etc sure no problem unfettered predatory capitalism will leave a barren waste land across the globe
fantastic speech but its very hard to comprehend  the computer voice please use a human its proven that consciousness of what you are saying helps to convey it to another human or animal
in the realm of formal discourse it is a recurrent observation that anarchocapitalists often assert that the trickledown economy does not constitute a prevailing form of tyranny within this economic paradigm the emergence of private monopolies can albeit unintentionally give rise to an alternative private governance structure ultimately resulting in limited substantial change furthermore it is frequently noted that individuals who lack expertise in the domains of industry and engineering tend to engage in discussions that extend beyond their sphere of knowledgeas a technocrat my commitment to opposing the ignorance and arrogance exhibited by anarchocapitalists fascists and proponents of unbridled capitalism remains unwavering and i shall persist in this endeavor until the end of my days the dystopian vision of our world is gradually materializing due to the dearth of expertise in the sectors that capitalists oversee consequently the distinction between a 1 led by knowledgeable individuals as opposed to the continuation of crony capitalism where expertise is often overlooked becomes a matter of paramount significance by embracing knowledge as the catalyst for change we hold the potential to reshape the course of our future paying homage to the legacy of visionaries like nikola tesla
the internet is still working fine for me
this is fake watch the mouth closely it glitches
bravoooooo  very well said president milei
protect this man at all cost
or the people could say we are good and have had enough we arent building shit anymore for anyone
but those companies in the past that had success were then bought out by larger companies who absorbed them into their own and then shut their independence down often sacking their labour force and creating high employment locally while moving production and service overseas to benefit from cheap employees and resources this created the monopoly we have today so the theory is there but it is not sustainable unless the monopoly is taxed to high heaven but then they just move operations uk has little or no industry now only financial growth by printing money that doesnt exist keeps the uk afloat the debt is increasing and the bubble is bursting and taxes are being increased or else inflation and vat to claw money back only cheap overseas goods are keeping the economy afloat and its funnelling all money out of the country as it goes to producers the rest of it in low  wages and profits for middle man sellers and shareholdersthis speech is ai generated and it should be taken down as its not him at all  its deep fake im surprised that you all cant spot that 
remarkable he said it all its what some of us have tried to voice to reach naive sheltered infantile westerners who have been so blind to history because of their ignorance due to a very good life that sheltered them from the evils of reallife
based
but the basic principles of capitalism were applied long before 19 century so attributing our economic growth to capitalism alone is silly additionally we see a technological stagnation in the west and worsening exploitation of the south by the hand of the very corporations youre defending right now  the development phase is over for us in the west its time to move forward
i dont think pointing to exponential growth from capitalism is not as strong a point in favour as milei would like to present it asbecause we have never found any sustainable system with exponential growth apart from the inflationary universe as a total maybe but that is kind of a moot point for any local scale systems we know that exponential growth must end at some point and the system then crashes until some form of floating equilibrium is reachedso the challenge is not to sustain exponential growth forever because we know we cant but to avoid a system crash and instead stabilise an equilibrium at the highest level possible
i didnt understand that part with ai doing to translation from spanish to englishthis guy is speaking in englishwhat am i missing 
his understanding of economics is woefully inadequate it makes for a great speech to blame every single problem in the world on one scapegoat though his political opponents if anyone is trying to convince you that what makes some people rich and others poor as the rich people are more free than the poor time to start throwing some massive grains of salt the people of china are significantly wealthier than those of argentina i dont think anyone in argentina would claim they are less free it is possible to be rich and repressed or free and poor i know it sounds really good to people struggling with economic hardship that all they need is a little more freedom and they can be just like the billionaires but all that extra freedom is just going to give them more power of you when you have to negotiate in the free market if a monopoly controls all of the food because you cant restrict the freedom of business how free are you
this is the truth but the controllers are trying to demonize capitalism  so we embrace socialism the elites love socialism  everyone is equal equally poor except for them
bravo this speech is the first one ive watched so far in my life that is so full of false dichotomy but so plausibly sounding
yes
he will probably be erased remember his name your cake is getting smaller
the og
thank you for speaking the truth to the megalomaniacs most are too timid to do so god bless milei
the rich people there want libertarianism for them and slavery for the rest of us  i think hes a plant
terrible editing
those who are listening to havier  in the room  those  are exactly those who are against free market capitalism they are puppets of  shadow and non shadow governments   sanctions  proxy wars no free speach anymore woke agenda and all the perverse movements   they are exactly those whom havier was speaking to and guess what  haviers speach was not even mentioned neither in our puuppet state media nor in any other major media
idk if its occured to anyone here that isnt in the 1 but the positivity this guy carries is not for you
get this austin powers out of here this guys an actor and yall some fools
basically the market is never wrongand if is wrong its the fault of somebody elselike a governmentthat was stupid enough to regulate a natural forcecentralised totalitarian government is badbut he seems to be proposing corporate totalitarianismin disguise as free trade
socialism or collectivism is nothing but ideological subversion of human society
every country that went neoliberal saw life conditions worseni predict bad times ahead for most argentinians in turn for foreign investors having a blast on their back
beautiful and aligned with earth growth
study the bills of exchange act which is basically the same for every country learn law merchant which is the law the world is run on that they hid by rolling it into the common law when they took away the gold they turned us all into merchants with our birth certificates and our signatures on pieces of paper becomes money per law merchant they use our signature on cheques promissory notes mortgages credit card transactions now digitalized etc  to turn pieces of paper into money in their hidden law merchant system we create the money with our signature which they take from our birth certificate trust account which they control and trade on security exchanges and also have us pay them back with interest that is how the rich have gotten rich every thing is done by contract they give us offers by advertisements through media etc if we dont say no weve tacitly agreed through our silence  another law merchant rule learn law merchant read bills of exchange act check out cal washington of the inpower movement who stumbled upon it and explains it all beautifully
i like this guy
as a scandinavian i gladly pay taxes capitalism is good but better nested inside a social democratic framework
its all about wanting power these people are suffering from the dunningkruger effect please look this up and see what kind of political leaders are being elected
new president like him and soon to come trumpand the lovers of freedom need to wake up and stop thisthis fascist taking birthwill end in tyranny
at last someone speaking common sense  the wef definitely needs a bucketload of this common sense  now
well he is right about the leftards but this only half right he should do some studies on economic growths
yeah baybayeee he looks like austin powers  get it
i agree with much of whats being said  foolish pride is a contributing factor to the downfall of western society the ignorant misunderstood notion that we are better is an erroneous concept we are just different when modern society begins the process of self governing and personal responsibility through self reliance and community involvement only then will the oppressive overreach of big government be deemed as a necessary evil will be reeled in by the reins of genuine representation of the peoples interests over corruption and greed
our life has been eroaded deliberately
i love president milei speech 
when he speaks of media appropriation for spreading socialist agenda who is he referring to
mm i think its a trap they wouldnt let this dude speak if they didnt have control  but his message is still needed for sure
wow hes taken on bill gates and the globalists
i agree with him now what about environmental impact of capitalism  how gdp per capita is good until we no longer have the resources to provide it 
i bet he was invited to the after party  
commonsense truth  
socialism never worked well in any country
why are you cutting the video when he mentions time lines shamefull you post free speech but censoring the video
i dont think he will be invited again
adam smith and milton friedman were theoreticians this guy can do what he is preaching good luck dude the big prize is near only a few harsh years
i agree with this man
i can see president milei understand economy in broad context if argentina need someone who can bring them out of poverty i believe this person might the answer so why dont you start scratching economy master plan act for argentina i bet you know better about your people culture and all aspects of their potential better than anyone else in the room
oh wait messi is in america  truer argentinian  my favourite favourite soccer player what are you doing my love  you said you would never do that i love you messi but please please with your power super power do something for your country regardles you are the king you have nothing to loose but an illusion 
he is so hard core free market capitalist as i was during my first years of economics studies then i grew up  and realized that if you dont regulate certain things in a reasonable way private sector will create extremely harmful externalities on society it will do sometimes winwin only for buyer and seller but fuck everyone else around it will cut all your trees and sell abroad to rich it will poison your air and water because business will not spend money in not value added activities for the final customer if not needed it will force you to pay insane price for 1sq meter of your apartment or pay insane rent to landlord from your working salary because rich money knows you need to sleep somewhere close to work so they will buy out everything to rent you everything free market is amazing only on the paper if you really are chasing it then go to the wild jungle there is no rules no laws and government i bet you not gonna like it for long 
such a strange contrast to hear this speech with wef backdrop
if he really wants to get more support he should invite all people and nations to the open market capitalism and not just the western ones thats exclusion is what invites and fuels leftists
why all the cut why dont you just upload the full speech
buzzwords buzzwords buzzwords
world economic fourm will save us all please please please save us  i am your happy slave love love you
argentina has the leader i whish all the best for them that argentina could become lighthouse for free world to rejuvenate its politics and economics stay strong argentina
truth is found when humans are taught with the eternal truth freely given worship adonai alone and ask him for truth he will give it freely and you will receive truth and freedom from lies
he is adorablegod bless his soul as they say in the southpoor argentina they will have to spread their messi legsgod bless argentina viva la western economy 
this man is a puppet of the united states regime change program in argentina people like these are liars  dubious and says something contrary to actions this is called the art of public deception cia is the master in this art this man will say a lot of things against the west against capitalism against united states just to prove that he is not the result regime change and to distance himself from usa but his actions will give him away just wait for a few months the truth will be out argentinians can forget falkland islands he will give it in a silver platter to ukhe will weaken the argentinian military and economy soon us and uk corporations will buy a lot of assets in argentina
he really sounds just like a south american trump i love it 
yeah capitalism and free market the best because unregulated corporations want no harm to the ordinary user of them like facebook and google want you to be happy and have a well balanced life not spent 90 on their platforms and they wouldnt cerainly use your data in a way you dont want it to be unregulated companies care about the environment above the cost of their profits like wolksvagen did and pharmaceutical corporations certainly wouldnt push and lobby for the use of drugs that can be highly addictive we need a freek market blind capitalism good any regulations or socialism bad
young benny hill no only me ok
the speech is perfect but it is ai generated
brilliant speech we definitely need more mileis in governments everywhere
wef is a terrorist organisation and should be proscribed
can he be our president too
well said the socalled elite they are the only ones that think they are elite will not listen to you elite have very strong mental issues
president trump 2024for peace prosperity security and freedom
love how he called govt npcs and entrepreneurs protagonists haha how perfect
why dub into english and reprogram his face asking for a friend
sorry too abstract also way too much personal opinion my desirable moral decisions are not the same as yours
the growth topic  now why 
did you hear that loud and clear obama
excellent speech with facts and data that is hard to dispute
this needs to be shared with those in our contact lists
what i dont like is not being able to understand him clearly in my own language  can all translators be trusted
he is a beast 
i have a new hero carajo
this guys is awesome   share this like cazy
i dont trust him i suspect  that the intelligence service of usa put him thereis he keen to join the brics
is he talking about the biden administration
 us needs a president who isnt afraid to call out the bullshit bravo sir
oh look argentinas new guy is wef who could have guessed sarcasm
good for all those  speaking up and out against the trend of the wef to control countries we want free enterprise and the right to speak without threats on our lives and businesses 
it destroyed australia because they the government allowed it to happen due to corruption australia will take 30 years to recover from the mess they created and thats if the government doesnt intentionally try to take away even more
i like how he can be crazy and unhinged and then switch to being deadly serious
agreed massive progress since the industrial revolutionand increase in living standards however some big losses of life along the waythat are of course omitted the loss of life in the colonisation of the americas the trans atlantic slave trade which some argue built the necessary wealth for industrializationnot forgetting the terrible working conditions of people labouring in factories throughout industrial countries in the 19th and 20th centuries so not everyones living standards increased certain populations in the world disappeared while  these advances were made also china would appear to be an exception in his argument that collective approach are always economic failuresof course he is totally right about the terrible loss of life involved in the project of communism is the environment really in a crisis he doesnt seem to think soand i really hope he is correct that it is a non issuecos no environmentmeans no trade of any kind
argentinas president is great
roflol over here in belgium the internet works fine
americans have embraced ignorance
superb speech very pleased to see such a robust defence of freedom and clearly point out issues we are facing glad to see it said at the wef on the internet and not censored there is much hope still and this will turn around  love from the uk
op conveniently left out the part where immediately after his speech they all applauded him the wef are not cryptocommunists they are the end point of liberal capitalism
this is heavily edited
did anyone from america speak probably not 
god bless milei
when your entire speech is a lie it is meant for indoctrination the comment section clearly shows many indoctrinated people who follow the leader sheep wherever it goes even off the cliff they have lost touch with themselves
ah yes because our famous capitalist system is so left and surpressed by the global southwait
its so obvious for many it was stated decades ago in atlas shrugged glad to hear it was uttered in this place
socialism or capitalism is not the problem its greed and corruption and incompetence in governments that is destroying the world economy
never heard it said better
thanks for the shitty clickbait no the internet is not broken in fact if it hadnt been for random youtube suggestions i would noy even know the speech happened
en dat in  het hol van de leeuw
no leftists outside of the room watched this
so explain how can china have lifted 850 million people out of poverty as a communist country how can china outperform the west on all economic metrics over the past 20 years
it is not capitalism that brought economic growth since around 1800 it is the division of labour as described by adam smith in the wealth of nations that has brought us such wealth
this video a messso many cuts can be heardheld back information
my hero
hey learned english very fast i saw his interview with tucker i belive and he didnt speak any english
i would become argentinian just to vote for this guy he is the messiah of this world crisis
so wef just allowed him to speak and challenge everything they stand for this is a psyop everyone needs to accept jesus and prepare for the infowar that is ramping up
there are none promoting socialism who have any honest desire to help those in need  they only wish to appear to be trying to help others  even while in fact they only seek to increase their own wealth and power
id like to see him address profiteering planned obsolescence and overconsumption
free market capitalism was a part of it yes but it was the discovery of oil that supported the massive expansion
 dropped 
hit the nail on the head 
but nothing ever gets done
he sounds like he was an adventurer once until he took an arrow to the knee
i have a feeling this guy is going to clinton i mean unalive himselfside note the censorship is so ridiculous its slowly changing our language
wef and un are are a cancer on the world
hear hear finally someone who speaks the it is imperative to all of us on this planet to follow what this man i said no truer speech has ever been spoken it is the speech of our generation and we must do something to preserve the democracy that we have america is suffering from the socialist bullshit and we must
im all for the translation and ai voice as it makes it easier accessible to manyit adds great accessibility to people who are visually impaired or have trouble reading the translation easilybut i dont like that some of the actual information was garbled and not clear or simply lost completely and yet you posted this video if there are glaring mistakes at least attempt to fix them using text or edit in a voiceover to fill the mistakes or something as a lot of people are going to watch this and his actual message is lessened by the glaring holes due to these very noticeable mistakes sure the original exists so most are good to go there and get the full actual thing but then why make this video at all dont be sloppyyou have over a million viewsa lot of those people may only ever see thisit is a disservice if it is not a good translation of exactly what he said as he said it regardless of translation i like that you did the voice translation dont get me wrong but not when the actual integrity of the full message has been lost and mostly due to glaringly simple errorsthis message deserves to be preserved and shared faithfully thanks
milei is right in principal but dont fool yourselves thinking our elites dont rule our world with their invisible hand government form or colour does not matter the idea of classic capitalism is not the reality we are longer living in we are not even talking about the 1 its probably 1 out of the 1 a man emerging out of the blue to become president im sure milei has understood one thing or two on his journey and im afraid he will be nothing but controlled opposition
this guy isnt saying what you think he is
welp i hope his life insurance is good best case scenario this speech is gonna be ignored and will be a waste of his time no one at wef has any interest in anything that doesnt involve bringing them more power
socialism has not led to poverty in scandinavia what does this egocentric budding dictator think he knows
i think he doesnt comprehend that the per capita rise is not from capitalism but from the speed the money revolves around the world in 1861 bell invented the telephone which gave people the opportunity to make deals with distant places without traveling there first the start of his hockey stick then came fax and finally now the internetwe could easily double maybe quadruple the per capita income with another speed boost but that does not have anything to do with the market system its just that our tools got betterif were all paid 10 times as much as now everyone all over the world nothing would have changed but every one would be much richeri dont think he knows what hes talking about at all
its a real sacril√®ge earing the holy word    d√©mocraty   in the sewers mouth of these rotten politics
it seems davos is in meltdown and its impossible to see the evil agenda isnt being exposed mr melei is one of many people banging a nail in their coffin 
i wouldnt be surprised if this is the smartest man in the world currently wow i am an entrepreneurial type i cant change that in me for several years now ive been looking for a place i belong im moving to argentina if possible
this is the first politician not talking out there lobbied behind in years only thing is there is a thing called psychological gas lighting so this seems fake why now all of a sudden while europes in tatters is this damage control by the evil girlfriend or boyfriend just wantingbyour back turned if its too good too be true then it is thats were we all at now celebrity cults kicking can down the road little pip boy gets smacked in face trying to eat out trash poor git is forced too eat bugs while owning nothing and told he owns nothing be happy oh and thats all a mistake now is it  all the wars burning protests and price raises and of a sudden ya like the old system you switched off in 2019  people all of sudden ending after a medical intervention all walks of life people yeah this very gas light red light green light oh its all a game now is it now ya fooked it all up
i am absolutely proud of argentina romania where is your voice
well done i like when he said it was a failure is still a failure and will ever be a failure 
just pushing slavery
free countries are 12x risher than repressed countries and citizens of free countries live 25 longer than citizens of repressed countries what more do you need to hear i like money and i want to live lmao
leftist dont like her they label him as far right
capitalism is best thing for economy its pure merit base
leftist need to understand socialism doesnt work
this speech was a banger lol
la pura verdad sin pelos en la lengua que dios cuide este hombre
great
it was alright until he said that monopolies are okay theyre nothe follows the same rhetorical principles neocons in the us didits not all about economic growth as in many instances economic growth only benefits those that already have a lothe said nothing about morals he just assumes that economic growth is great in itself which isnt true
brilliant
you wanna know the truth ill give you a hint that explains lots  cattle mutilation phenomena was actually gain of function research  the products were to be scaled up in ukraine and deployed on russia and usa using classified drones  
the president of argentina warns against the new marxism that has become dominant in the westwe see him here in iceland too these new marxists are doing great damage to the west with woke and cancel culture and socialismargentina knows the way of socialism and javier milos is the man who has to unearth the broken glass of socialism and the scorched earth of socialismits just destruction that comes with socialism it can be explained by anything called social democracy or whatever this is a bankruptcy policy
ill fight against any tyrannical lawsas an american i will not comply
liberalscommies love to talk about repression yet fail to see how repressive the socialist system they praise is
bravo
god bless javier malie for the exposure of the kabala mafias monopolist agendafreedom economic and individual from bureaucracts
milei  wef these and antithese always leads to synthesis milei is on the antithese side
all this narratives talking who is right and who is wrong this is hes narrativ made upp from collective knowledge
god will never let that happen again this is me telling hell no
constitutional libertarianconstitutional based principles of protecting everyones rights and not allowing encroachment of independent citizens of republics can give a fair flow of negotiated results instead of wars
capitalism is good as long as politicians arent allowed to take money from companies to get special treatment so that they make laws that prevent smaller companies from growing like we have here in the us where our corrupt politicians take bribes and what not from large corporations like black rock and walmart and other and so on so theyre allowed to grow and expand but the small guy trying to make a living with his family business is driven out of business covid also helped with that to cause only large corporations were allowed to stay open and small businesses had to shut down and eventually went broke and out of business
if only america could get back to this model
capitalist delusion
quid pro quo joey obeyden rogue regime is inept and corrupt the world is seeing what it will look like another 4 years of the influence of the united nations wefcfr controlling foreign policiesindependent national interest should be priority one in bilateral negotiations with all other nations is the only way to get a flow of value via currency that is pegged to valued assets this speech is what is needed to be taught to the mbas graduates
because of capitalism we came to the point where people like the rothschild become so rich that they own 80 of wealth this is under no circumstance acceptable because of this we have these ultra rich conspire against the huminaty i think that capitalism is to blame because this is a natural consequence of capitalism
everyone is waking up to the bull crap 
this aays it all
sure he did while he just made a corporate police division in his own country the guys a shill wake up people
the result of a free market without government intervention is a monopoly the only logical result is the victory of multiple large companies that swallow any smaller challengers before they could grow to a competitive size in the end the best company will swallow the other large companies ending the oligopoly and becoming a monopoly in which one company determines the production and the price distribution thus the outcome is a centralized production even if it is less efficient than the production of multiple companies with consumer choice
we german got stomped into the ground after we became socialist be carefull because they will fight back they dont like defeat that is why they run from country to country and become the most persecuted people in the world from my research i can argue that socialism works great because after we have been bankrupt as germany we kicked them out and made our homeland nice again within 3 years from bankrupt to nice if everyone goes hard to repair the land end government after the infiltrations then everyone will profit from the clean up i dont get whats wrong about thatsocialism is not communism
lets see whether his free world fellow rich men can give him what he claims to desire
there are no market failures only failed models
you know when adults are told what they can and can not say  yet the children are handed grand theft auto desensitized rude little demons who grow to lust in destruction
crisis actor
what a load of jumbled nonsense
bravo
javier you are a great man
wow
after all the clickbaits that broke the internet i just wanna say mine works just fine not gonna watch this clickbaitbullshit just wanted to share my side of the story

if javier wasnt controlled oppisition he would have called out the sabbateanfrankists aka the bolsheviks
the state is the problem
il ma scotch√© 
the truth has no expiration date to quote mrs margaret thatcher  pm uk the problem with socialism is that eventually it will runout of other peoples moneyfacts 
so refreshing and brave leader hope to see more like him sadly today you see more and more soft leaders around the world
youtube doesnt like truth deleting my comments
amen to that
taxes destroyed the regular business in the united states we have lost so many businesses some have moved to other countries south of our border where its cheaper to produce in the 1980s michigan united states of america lost a ton of factories for this exact reason at that time i was graduating high school so all the boys that graduated with were looking for jobs right along with older men with experience and im not talking a few older men im talking about thousands just in my community
i am so grateful for this mans courage
western countries have no valuesno respect for human beings and rich men and big pharma and militaroindustrial complex are destroying the worldwhat a pity
controlled opposition

invest  in that land
is he as prophesied by parravicini argentinean nostradamus the gray man el hombre gris
am i the only one that thinks this looks like ai generated talking
did the ai also change his lip movements to be in sync with the dubbed speech thats creepy on the other note its refreshing to hear voices that speak for freedom
problem is free markets crash
norway is called socialist  a social democracy and is filthy rich the same goes for russia in europe  the more market liberalism the more fragile the economy maybe south americas works different  time will tell
the most ignorant and incompetent politician ever total lack of history knowledge it is scary that he is allowed to enter politics will totally ruin argentine with his experiment
it is been modifiedmanipulated in 1539
why did you cut out so many words
hey that ist not the original vod its clipt on some parts wich are not seen here so go search the original and see 4 yourself waht hast been hidden from you 
experiments are never the solution to the problems afflicting the citizens  unironically said by the guy radically deregulating his own country and inflicting all sorts of the most braindead economical moves truly argentina is in the hands of a madman you have to be braindead to follow a man that cant even keep up with basic logic in his own speech
bravo
lo siento pero estas teorias serian buenas en un mundo perfecto donde los hombres se respectan el capitalismo de olivetti que decia que entre un ceo y el ultimo de los obrero la diferencia de salario tenia que ser maximo 25 a 1 hoy la diferencia es mediamente 750 a 1  ademas en un mundo de lobos super competitivo y de hijos de putas si no hay contrrol seria un desmadre y a salir ganando serian solo los que no tieben escupulos las grandes corporation y las mafias cuidado
its amazing how good the truth soundslove it stick it to em and spread the truth god bless brother
po polsku prosze
wow  
is it moment of birth recordocracy
to say otherwise will get you killed right
  thank you 
truth slayer 
a monopolized market is in fact socialism and only monopolys as a result of radical free market gain the power to coerce competition into failing markets the is a fundamental illogically mismatch in his whole argumentation line neither left nor right proof success in the history when turned into extreme neo liberalism turned already a lot of people back into poverty in the western hemisphere and each model esp in south america has to fail in the face of corruption not the system but corrupted people in power cause the issue
at last someone talking sense im moving to argentina for sure  thank you sir   
argentina  new free world 
i agree with all except about government not limiting monopolies look at what happened in the us and eu pharma companies dictate health laws and regulations not doctors 
43000000 usa citizens should chose between eating or buying medicines this does not occurs in europe
argentina and the uk should work together to get that oil out of the sea bedid even go for a 3070 in argentinas favoureveryones a winner
ai is so cool
we have never had more billionaireswe have never in the history of man had more single menwomen with a hundred million dollars in the bankwe have youtube idiots worth millionsthe rich have no intentions of sharing their massive bank accounts
what has been cut out from the speech why not just release the full speech 100 unedited
report this video its a deepfake
bravo milei you have a smart and realistic brain what a pleasure to hear you telling the truth 
give the man an elvis suit
what a brave hero standing up for the truth about capitalism finally someone did it  the dire consequences of socialism in such a concise manner how are people so deceived on this topic  especially when comparisons between the economic models are on display for the world to see  why is it that immigrants still flock to america with the capitalist model we dont see them flocking to china or russia not do we question will this hero get to see our comments which are applauding him may god protect this hero
who invented communism marxism socialism and bolshevism
we are not economic zones we are nations for specific people we need demographic protections and someone to think about our future 200 years from now not 4 years
be sure to cut every word out as much as u can
a long time avid member of the wef who wants to close argentinas central bank 
you have no idea what youre talking
it is interesting how the german mainstream media chose to portrait this speech of course it was not objectively covered since our once strong country is slowly being turned into a communist shole piece by piece year by year by its enemies from the within and the without almost all german media complies to this plot to keep public order up as long as possible until the destruction is complete
he says many things but he does the oposite come and live in argentina to see by yourself
thisaaiirr
good ai
isnt he just a puppet for the us government he says a lot of words does not seam to be his own
yehbut that ship has sailed globalisation is dead and argentina is going to be used as inflation export country eating all the empty dollars printed in the last 4 years no prosperity comes from thatthey are going to be used as a condombut maybe it is a fatealso cant say argentina has been any good in planed economy unlike the sovietsthey literally rebuild their country after total annihilation of the cities fighting nazi europe which has been quite remarkable tbh
wooooo yes a powerful speech
magnificent thank you do much farzad for making this vital speech available share it everyone everywhere
the bloody abortion agenda he says
whats wrong with a bit of socialism the uk manages to upkeep then nhs well recently its starting to break down a country should be balanced and educated and collectivism is about being proud of country and culture america is too extreme with capitalism
well done god bless argentina
well  said
every high school graduate should know all this but their teachers push marxism and gender ideology on students instead
isnt it interesting that these good guy populist type politicians sound in many ways just like the creepy deep state cabal goons both are focused on gdps wall street numbers banks crypto returns on investment taxation big business wars never calling them mass murders and elections for corporate office never once mentioning that both sides are obsessed with winning a spot as an officer of some private forprofit corporation masquerading as a country whether it be argentina inc or us inc or some other they never want to talk about the concerns of the rest of us such as the poisons being sprayed on us the poisons in our food and water their profitable child trafficking rings using our children their fake corporate tribunals masquerading as courts that have no duty to protect us only to shake us down for fines and fees and their obsessive stealing of our lands among their other crimes they dont like to talk about so tell me  again  what the hell is the point of voting for our next corporate slavemaster
sounds good but all those theories doesnt take into consideration that now we got huge corporations working almost like international cartels  so total freedom for them means total control of the market mark my words 
controlled opposition  you muppets
a very brave leader
savaged when we do ravaged if we wont wolves await us the little guy no matter which pathway we are offered here in the jungle of our lives we dont win those are the rules for us
why does it seem like the video is trimmed in a bunch of areas in the video was this intentional to just make the video shorter or is this a very odd constant lag in the video ill have to look up the original video to  see if theres a difference
ironically in circumstances described by him the role of government would be breaking cartels and monopolies protecting trade secrets and investigating money laundering and hit jobs between entrepreneurs heathy capital climate needs harsh crackdown on unfair players unfortunately
may god protect our fearless leaders of this world against the darkness of evil in the end good truth will triumph and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it
what a king best of wishes from israel and freedom is the real deal to prosper and live better lives
libertarianism yes
so is he saying dont fix your government just turn it over to corporate control instead so the _ can flow  his speach sure was memorizing  great stuff  thanks for sharing
amen god bless him and god savehelp us all
such a clown
socialism is just repackaged feudalism
hes a 
philippine politicians wont like this
the  damn ideotic socialists of the german political partys should listen to this man hes absolutely right
god bless this president
capitalism has never benefited the workers or the general public ever while socialism always has
wow finally a man brave enough to take them on  god protect him 
javier milei  thank you for your comprehensive educational speech to the world all power to democracy and  condemnation and an end to the creeping evil of socialism we have witnessed it first hand in new zealand with jacinda adern a very dangerous person now operating out of america
remember folks javier did not kill himself
god bless sir
poverty is intentionally manufactured these stats are the most bogus thing i ever heard all of the indigenous people of the world lived without poverty before imperialism
what a president they should all be like him
it says ai was used to translate his speech from spanish to english but his lips are matching the words he says
am i the only one that  suspects this whole drama is theateri mean could that gollumesque yuval harrari and darth vaderish karl scwabb be any more stereotypical of  villains from a  dystopian future movie
thank for speaking the truth
senior milei is just trolling the davos elitesthe man recently devalued the argentina peso from 400 to 800 per 1 us dollar and then by an additional 2 each month
this is excellent and in capsules many actions undertaken by western governments taking away the freedoms of the nations they rule over one small piece at a time this is all well grounded in history milie is not a sooth sayer but a man who speaks a sober truth with accuracy this is worth listening to a number of times to catch all of the many things he covers
new world order is gay
if someone tells you the solution is simple you better run sorry but pure something is more deadly than anything else if you want the taste of pure capitalism play monopoly it always ends in tears
god bless argentina
this funny  speech broke the internet with laughter that never ever seen
argentina poverty rate rises to 401 in first half of 2023
get these criminals out of offices once and for all
if the technology existed to remove muscles from a body builder and redistribute them into lazy people who belive in socialism they would do it they would say that its unfair this body builder has so much muscle  take his hard earned physique and redistribute those muscles to all of us for the good of our community so we can all look good   is this fair in any way to the body builder how is it any different taking someones money property or anything else someone worked for
repeating these words is the biggest lie
cool speech but free market capitalism is what gave us the wef now they want to pull the ladder up and give everyone under them a stool
has putin seen this
alas the man with a crazy haircut turns out to be the least crazy person in the entire room 
awesome
this guy really is bonker capitalism doesnt work well be left with 1 bank 1 oil company 1 govt a new world order where us commoners are mere slaves for the rich worse than things are now endless growth simply isnt possible
the 19th century explosion in gdp per capita had nothing to do with economic systems and everything to do with physics namely the physics applied to energy obtained from fossil fuels and uranium used to power millions of machines no economic system including free market capitalism has ever produced a single watt of energy that being the case doubling the gdp means doubling energy consumption which can only meet some constraints sooner or later since by definition the amount of energy available including renewable energy is and always will be limited on a finite planet
i didnt even realize this was ai english until they zoomed in
thety say what we want them to hear to get to do whatever they want to accomplishis just tactics change to make us more real and complacentdo not trust anything they say
awesome simply awesome
his dogs a very clever they wrote his speach
monopolies are a failure
he is wrong markets are good but they dont fulfill the necessary roles of governance and long term planning
its all from the perspective of humans
does ai match his lips to the words and severally edited or is that ai as well
but at what expense though
an unregulated free market economy will inevitably fall victim to the greedy just like governments economies need checks and balances all systems of government and economic structures have the same fatal flaw dishonest and greedy people capitalism is in my opinion the best system around that being said if you think an unregulated market is the only magic formula for success you truly have the rosiest of rose tinted glasses on
this speech was chopped way to go youtub its ok i still understand whats being said basically our government is unhinged
thing is they are in capitalism just the late stage that is controlled by a few oligarchs 
i love this guy
there it is
i wish people would hear what he has to say and change  there are powers of evil operating in this world that blind men and make us irreconcilable jesus is the answer
i wish people would hear what he has to say and change  there are powers of evil operating in this world that blind men and make us irreconcilable jesus is the answer
i feel like hes an alien from a type 4 civilization in disguise out here normalizing the key to true wealthrespect on his soul man
nice bro
wow an eye opener bravo mr president  total respect
milei will never k himself
he is scary
awesome
it wondering his mic was working the whole speech
awesome speech but just wait left media  and entertainment in us will bully and make fun of him i can see it now on jimmy kimmel or snl the left will mock and bully him on tv but screw it we got trump coming back also buy bitcoin lets go
why is there so much audio clipping some his words are lost as a result does anyone have a link to the original version
praise godmsy god bless and keep and use this man
every progressive nation stole from africa through looting and slavery thats how the became wealthy so sir your speech could be mislead
zionist belief in the world is a negative impact
its ironic to give such speech at the wef wef has programs for young entrepreneurs to shape  mold them in the direction they want them to gocanadas president justin trudeau is a great example of that and so many like him in high powerful positions are groomed  selected by the wef this was a great speech no doubt about itmaybe too great and not aligned with what the wef has been doing since its conceptions its a speech given to hide what really was discussed in closed doors
gracias milie en cuba y venezuela te amamos gracias por decir verdades
dont cry for me argentina
if believing that everyone should have a room to live and food to eat is socialism then call me a socialist
yes we are moving into an era of decentralisation
trump 2024
if people are wondering how this speech is hosted by wef understand what wef actually is  its basically a membership of the largest corporations in the world  ofcourse they support capitalism  it is front and center to their own interests as well they dont want some ubi socialist world  because that means the death of their megabusinesses where the wef doesnt align with moral virtue is that they will milk governments instead if consumers are no longer consuming their goods basically they are all for taking your money one way or another  and for their own business survival all this proposal does is speak to the honest route of capitalism rather than cronycapitalism
the state of our states is not so great mate i ponder the weight of the gate to be opened to release us from this fate how much longer do we have to wait to reunite as one and take back the whole cake 
of course he would be against free market capitalism because it limits government control on individuals in particular poorer people wef is always speaking for the top 1 who are not affected by any government interventions if anything governments have been so corrupt as to pass laws that favour corporations and the rich  so that issues such as environmental sustainability and medical advancements if not advances in technology are controlled so as to benefit the rich and not the poor meaning that we are not advancing and this social degradation that this so called leader is talking about is caused by government corruption not by the poor but by large corporations passing laws that degrade society of course this idiot is just another wef puppet
thank you for sharing your thoughts  wef is out of control
thought he was funny af and pretty on point with his outbursts but this speech man the world needs more leaders like him agree to 100 
the usa is in turmoil and chaos thanks to the joe biden and the modern democrat party  bidens cabinet is a precursor to the destruction of the united states of america
long life from freedon damm it
argentina is blessed with gifts like natural resources beautiful land spirited people ive known a fewit has a bright future with this i hope to watch them advance beautifully
based argentinian
socialism is the worst for people all over the world
160 years ago the usa  argentina were on an economically even playing field but high taxes socialist policies  lax stances on crime caused argentina to lose foreign investment become infested with gangs stymie the growth of their middle class  see their birthrate grind to stagnation due to pheminism now after all this time the people have had enough i predict this ideological whiplash will happen across the west as people wake up to the realities of their frankfurt school institutions  who they really serve
it seems like he may have switched his speech at the last moment
hear that  the bed wetting lefties who think fair  is undoing the work of aspiring people the communist tenet of  from each according  to need   to each according to ability  is a myth  communism gives to the elite party members and takes from  everyone else until the profit motive is no longer relevant social marxism hides under names like social justice  and rides the public purse and becomes reliant without private aspiration whereby soon every hard luck story is feeding off the public purse the market mechanism is the most responsible method income redistribution excellent work pres milei  youll have many followers
this is what every nation needs economic freedom is the key to prosperity it always has been social freedom and strong families help with happiness
legend
something is o f f with this video 
argentina has tapped out after many years of socialists rulewell see how much clout the new freemarket president of argentina will have and there are hordes of leftists in argentina against him in parliament and in the courts
it took an argentian president javier milei to school the west on political science bravisimo 
hes talking about biden and his democraps 
amen
brillante presidente milei haz despertado conciencias aqui en mi patria y ahora lo haces con el mundo viva la libertad carajo
that sounds nice and all but how am i supposed to keep my sex dungeon stocked with a fresh supply of children under such a systemtypical member of the wef
damn he laid it down
brilliant
yazzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
a libertarian one more dont understand basic economic
thank you for speaking some hard but honest truths  i am in complete agreement with everything you stated i live in the united states  i do not agee with the decisions being made by the federal government but feel powerless to make any change  the peoples voices here have not been heard for many years by the leadership in the country
the translation has substantial mistakes
hes a tool of the establishment he bent the knees to the jews already its not an authentic speech
thank you president milei i wish you could push some common sense into president lopez obrador and his gang full of good intentions lacking of intelligence and common sense
what this propagandist  fool is not telling you is 1 how that growth has been achieved by the hard work of the many while only the few have reaped the rewards gdp per capita doesnt take into account redistribution of the wealth the great pyramids also have been wonderful achievements but the slaves were given only water and bread while the pharaos were the owners of the pyramids gdp per capita means nothing without wealth redistribution index the only class that is growing in wealth is the rich class thus increasing artificially the average2 the free market favors the richer trade partner not poor countries poor countries cannot compete with rich countries this is why the world is divided into 1 billion that leads normal lives and 7 billions that live in poverty so much for the achievements of capitalism excuse my french but i dont wanna live in world where 1 out of 7 people lives good while the rest wallow in poverty so that 1 can live good
halleluyah amen
viva la libertad carajo
the lord reigns over all the earth forever halleluyah amen
yes keep church and state seperate keep papal dogma out and the green out of peoples lives we dont want the dark ages back i pray for this mans protection
wow i have been waiting for a world leader to rise up and speak the truth about the benefits of capitalism freedom and limited government good job socialism has never worked and has caused so much pain to the people of the world
this is why the government should stop buying out companies if there overpriced let them fail
some elite capitalists and bureaucrats are cringing and feels like they are being undressed revealing their hideous greedy monsters inside
i agree with him 100  and the whole word too
argentina is not freethe spanish invaded it
 yesss
ready to move to argentina 
why does he have indian accent
how could the the wef allow a man that uses facts figures and free market beliefs into its circle jerk of a meeting that is traditionally driven only by ideology and nothing else
marxism is the best on paper but actually does not work in reality socialism is dumb
the elitist already see him as a threat
protect this hero at all cost
definitely not controlled opposition
truth
the only thing i can say is that it would work as long as tariffs and antitrust actions are enforced by a government with teeth without these wouldnt you just get bought out by lower priced external labor or products killing your economy or large to mega corporations stunting your innovation or basic competition in market i mean antitrust at the minimum right cough cough america
lets hope the dont anheroe him
argentina will own nothing and be happy lol
this dude is definitely robin williams faked his death to help save humanity
under economic theory this is a very populist analysis but hell prove em wrong
this is the biden socialism
wef is changing the tone of their propoganda now
i love this manthe entire west should listen hard and realize the citizens of their countries will rise up unless the elites stop  pushing their one world order
fahayek
prosperity and progress for some on a dead planet for all yeah 
javier has committed political and social suicide with his speech he just doesnt realize it yet   
the market failure is always directly from and by the corruption of the state individuals government of that area  they steal all the tax money and more and launder it back into their pockets  the biden family has done this four decades and most of the leftist democrat party but also half or more of the republicans as well  they are thieves and grifters and government is too big
i only ever heard from people that he was crazy but ive never once seen any proof of that congrats on a real president looks like the usa will get one soon
sadly he is speaking to the people that want to destroy capitalism not support it wef is dangerous and needs to be dismantled
bravo now that is common sense
spain may want to borrow a page from mr milei book
freedom and the  complete destruction of the wef bravo
and here i thought obama was uber professorial  what a clown
when good times make weak men weak men create hard time well hard times create strong men welcome to hard times and watch strong men do hard things to make good times and this man is not suicidal if dies you need to know the elite is trying to stop this message
very likely the most important speech in the history of davos
bravo
all these guys are connectedthey owns 44 billion to imf  imf is a member of wef  they talk crap to distant themselves its a game
javier are you insane not socialism any ism is the danger but neverending greed of the already rich fk the rest and all the poor kids want to be rich rockstars so much
useless speech no real substance just verbose
the only  man who has balls
yes brodcast this speech to china well done  president milei  well done lets hopes world leaders listen and take action
 yeah  concentration of wealth is not a market failure in neo classical economics aside from that this is some amazing oratory ive never someone offer such a narrative of iron clad rhetoric was he just reading ayn rands atlas shrugged verbatim that wouldve been the capitalist thing to do
i wish argentina the best  lets have another conversation at the end of mileis term  as far as im concerned he hasnt accomplished anything for his country yet so why is he lecturing
there is light breaking through
argentina clearly needs major reform but pretending that monopolies help people and market failure does not exist is not the way to get there  it only broke the internet because it  is monumentally stupid  a year 11 economics student could refute pretty much everything he said as nonsense  and his reading of economic history is laughably childish simplistic and innacurate  yet another mindless demagogue in it for the billionaires
the wef and their ilke will be make a footstool 
wow spot onwasnt expecting to hear this  from that stage love it
so many lies mashed with cherry picked and misrepresented facts in order to push an agenda of control over the masses sad the prophets orwell and huxley were right
he mentions the left is the problem and that a democratic society isnt the direction to go in i have always believed that all humans need to prosper even the decrepit among society capitalism has proven time and again that profit is king and everyone at the bottom is out of luck and should get better jobs if they cant feed their families  its a shameful system that needs major changes
klaus libertarians are a threat
lets watch the rothschilds and wef  tied countries reaction to argentina over the next several years  see how foreign policy will help or hinder them__________power by the few in any format will always cause hardship for the ones at the bottom  even capitalism needs to be constrained by a free  educated citizen base   human beings basic intrinsic value must be the foundation not merely humans being  economic productive units   not advocating socialism whatsoever but theres responsibility to have a longterm view to preserve the founddation  from which a company or country prospers_the flaw in it is the consolidation of wealth  during the industrial revolution oil  steel barons controlled the politics of the time and it took worker bloodshed and much  poverty and suffering before things got so out of touch and out of tune it shocked the average middle class person and violence erupted often by people who wanted to work    human greed screws up every good plan  its needs balance     theres flaws  capitalism and libertarianism need to be constrained 
thats a lot of words to say go woke go broke
is it a blue screen ai thing or hologram unnatural twitching
this guy totally gets it
born in communist poland and fully agree with mr president of argentine in todays eu i can see more utopia censorship and law violence than ever seen in communist country tbh
free market do not fail  if they fail check if there is a government disruption  interference  cant be more right  the tenantlandlard act is a typical example that interfered how a free market supposed to fix the problem made the rental market such a big mess
educationcoersion of tradesmen is the only fight against socialism and communismcapitalism
hope this is real the video looks pretty fake
capitalism has never been observed to increase wealth and decrease poverty it has always all the time increased wealth for 1 while 99 falls below the poverty level into destitution that is fact there can be no equality in a plutocratic oligarchy which is what capitalism is its all it can ever be if it is functioning properly which it is
canada is laughing higher tax means less productivity and less freedom canada is going to 100 taxation people surround all their income to taxes and then receive a tiny portion back to live through welfare by the mercy of gigantic socialism government
this is what you call high hopes blah blah blah
mileis speech is a symbol of hope that wisdom and reason will prevail
countries that are more free there aint no real free country mate i will debate you on that
–¥–∞–≤–Ω–æ —è –Ω–∏—á–µ–≥–æ —Ç—É–ø–µ–µ –Ω–µ —Å–ª—ã—à–∞–ª
they think some sort of great speech will work how many times have we heard this in history
national socialist are now world socialist to understand the dominion machine beta test in venezuela oil   america still hate us for 1918 and 1945
tears  you are an amazing man
the best system is a mixed system of socialism and capitalism with a democratically elected govermentcapitalism to generate the money socialism to keep the work force healthy and safe police doctors fire fighters job seekers allowance and state support for the elderly and infirm and state pensions are all socialist institutions neccessary for a healthy populace
dont be intimidated by the political cast or the parasites who live off of the state dont yield to a political cast that only wants to prolong its power and preserve is privileges javier milei
human leaders suck at everything
the problemis he acts like free market isnt broken we arent poor the world is about have a trillionaire stop the communists blame bs it isnt working we arent poor and we all work harder than ever we just arent paid enough to be convinced to keep the system running smoothly
well this man has definitely done his research and is profoundly smarter than most politicians
environmental negative externalities ie pollution is an example of market failure that i think is conveniently brushed over by javier here and what population control is he criticising afaik everyones head is in the sand on that front birth control is about personal freedom and nothing else
im bout hop a plane to chill argentinians
fools hes blatant controlled opposition youre falling for another trump
i wish he was our us president
so there is a hockey stick graph that laissezfaire capitalist can get behind
no wonder the american news media calls him a far right extremist
well done argentina love from britain
god damn his glasses are soooooooo flexible like  can i have a pair i also want them to no clip into my face xdfor real thoughdude does make a lot of sense envy is no way to be
turn the world into all consumers and we make more money
viva milei trump and bukelepedro s√°nchezgo to the jail
what a great speech
chap√≥ milei ahora falta que gobierne trump y que pedro s√°nchez vaya a la c√°rcel con toda su mafia viva la libertad
i doubt any world leaders will read this message but i believe if those who are blind with greed power or money spend fewer resources on control and more on freedom they will be respected as leaders rather than fearedhated for tyranny  how much do china and north korea spend on controlling the masses and espionage rather than creating wealth freedom and safety in their countries  i hoped putin would see the power of a strong education system and economic freedom and use that to focus on building a stronger country  conversely in the usa it has been the economic powerhouses who have had corrupting influence over the system through lobbyists and media control  in all of these collectivism cases it ends up with leaders who think they know what is best rather than leaders who know how to maximize the untapped power of human capital  most versions of capitalism are stronger if they encourage and protect the growth of ideas that benefit humanity
100
people need to work though and people need to the jobs that people dont wanna do like masonry trash services waste treatment concrete iron working oil ridges construction jobs there will be no infrastructure  no life quailities to be prosperous
well done
dont cry argentina  you asked for it you got it
viva la libertad carajo 
hes got the background to see what the clowns are trying to do and the knowledge to make argentina great again prayers for all of argentinians  may you prosper beyond your wildest dreams god bless 
too much editing in this vid so i dont trust it not to mention apparent ai translation  the original of this vid gratefully supplied gives me more confidence in what javier mlei actually said
its pretty much immoral to ignore how good capitalism is  capitalism is the system that is responsible for lifting more people out of poverty than any other system in the history of the world
this man is taking in the assembly made by the ones who do what he is talking against
they want to make western world china  total control  but sistematicly brainwashed western free people  are groomed to be sheeps
today i am here to inform you that the real threat in the western world are populists like this guy who spin a tale of dangerous leftists trying to take all our freedom but in reality they want to undermine democracy and act like absolute rulers you know the kind that take away your freedom
sounds like hes talking about the conservative government
thanks in germany if you look into gov workers there are not comparable witz the freemarket its so sad to see how we get melked 4 others
   great speech great man   
lol his answer to poverty is capitalism yeah because people have never used it to benefit the rich over the poor its not like capitalism only works with a class system if people want freedom stop living the dreams of politicians stop letting people tell you what to do
because all thats been working reeeeeaaaal great so far
u should read bioshock
yep lunatics everywhere
wonderful but hes not the first hes just one that got through without being assasinated  so many great and smart people have fallen to the wicked who want to subjugate and dominate without any hindrance for their own selfish ends  it takes a very large group of like minded people to make a society prosper not one or two
im very pleased to hear the new president of argentina giving his analysis of the western world its just precise and well presented i salute the president and pray for his success 
salvini  meloni farage vannacci lepen boris johnson when they will make a speech like thisi will change my gender 
i wish american politicians spoke like this to those fools dont even try to put trumps name in there he had a chance to make a speech like that and he passed and then he sat with one of the biggest communist senators in america and spoke about violating americans rights and stealing their guns without due process sounds like freedom to me right all from a guy that campaigned on constitutional carry
28k communists left thumbs down on this video that should tell you something
champion
he is right engineers designed concorde as a 300seat plane but politicians changed it to 100 seats so it was never economically viablepoliticians have dogma and rarely understand how to make money for a company or a country
was this before or after the witch doctor breathed on all the attendees  im curious as to whether anyone declined the blessing
this isnt a new idea however the american ppl continue to willingly foot the bill for the luxurious lives of our government and corporate overlords the american ppl truly believe they have some kinda say this is heartbreakingly comical we arent gonna be able to come back from what government and corporate leaders have done to us this time the masses did not benefit from this debt  prepare for whats ahead for the united states we deserve it for sitting back and allowing it 
they became the worlds first dominant power 95 of the world didnt even know where that country is on the map at any given time  lmao   noone ever gave a crap about argentina besides football fans and margaret thatcher and we all know how well that went for the gouchosthe product argentina is most known for is beef and tango  not technology not science or any form of significant cultural achievements beeftango  manodonna guys oh yes and housing old nazis from germany hahahaha
argentinian peso 
i want to move to argentina now  
talk is cheap
this guy is so fun
but now we got mega capitalists like musk  zuckerberg etc
fantastic  well said 
whats with all the cuts in this upload looks to me someone has cherry picked what words they want to share 
socialism doesnt make you poor its the people in chargewe shouldnt listen to wef puppets
maximum respect from greece 
hopefully his speech wont be used by the davos people as a pressure valve to lessen the intensity with which citizens of the world are reacting towards the socialist agenda for mass control
the globalists are trying to control the world and suppress our freedomevery country should not comply to their evil agenda especially the demons in the world economic forumthey want to impose global communism and rob us of our freedom and sovereignty of every nation in the world
free the world from zionism 
kleptocrats we dont trust you and we dont believe you it will take some short term sacrifice but vote with your money
good on you president milei true words well expressed
what he says about market failures are 100 true the us government has the attitude that institutions are to big to fail which breaks the cycle of free exchange of property this is the case any time tax dollars are taken and redistributed they put institutions on life support in the hopes of controlling a few leading companies by threat of withdrawing money from them thereby creating a communist economy where a few control the many
 se lo dijo su perro muerto a ver lo que dura
no no no free market capitalism is not the way to go its not sustainable to nature we dont need to grow we need to stop and clear the oceans nuture nature its not a question of money its a question of clean nature that isnt destroyed by this way of thinking if farmers have unspoiled land they can work if oceans are clean and the balance respected we can live money isnt life youve got it mixed up
the world is being destroyed by the greedy billionaires and their politician puppets all over not democrat not republican both
yeah and hitler lived happy and all those nazis
fear mongering
he sounds kinda like an argentinian jfk
why cant we get men like him running for office is america hes more american than everyone elected currently
market is not god it regulates in a very brutal way and not really care about future etc he is saying many stupid things socialism with christian face and relative free market where most important sources belong to the people and not just few who have appropriated all things under their power and control 
this wacko wont last a year in office
its process not democracy what they scream dictionary says process means democracy blah research
poor argentina drowning in shit 
hypocritical position people are not born with the same starting point if you do not address this issue first and do not understand that philosophy of eat what you have earn etc is a trap and distortion of far complex world  those who are rich do not to quick to share their opportunities 
how about  america worries about itself and every country worries about itself
why then did he decide for argentina to not join brics but to kowtow to the us
commenting and liking so algorithm spreads this more
he is just saying what should be obvious for everyone but leftists will never understand
it is hard to believe in the invisible hand there is hard truth out there and truth is that capitalism is being abused to the point that we are loosing jobs in here in america in the name of a bigger profit for the few on top that is happening in private corporations that lay off employees citing looses when their profit are sky high communism and socialism are bad democracy is turning out to be socialism as it is abused and applied based closely to the tenants of socialism so i believe that capitalism is the best way out so far but we cannot say that the abuse of capitalism is turning our social structure into a 2 tier society of poor and rich the middle class is disappearing
this guy has been reading his sowell and friedman
if the internet is broke how am i watching this good video stupid title
excellent speech thank you so much for speaking out for we the people who seem to not have a voice any longer
tyranny by bureaucracy
if we are forced into one world government  i choose him as our leader
we dont want socialism or communism
so what about when capitalist dont care about workers health safety the environment how about failures in capitalism it does not seem like we are on a track towards socialism but more on track for unregulated capitalism capitalism fails when profit is the sole motivation rather than concern for humans health well being or the environment
el √∫nico capaz de coercionar el mercado es el estado   amen 
thank you
thank you  president    poverful speech 
yeah right if only it wasnt capitalism that is driving inequality poverty homelessnes crime and war across the globe for over three decades deadly propaganda built on the common lies of billionaires and the majority eats it up like honey capitalism is what is ultimately killing species including our own
i agree with the president of argentina
brilliant speech every leader of the western world actually the whole world should listen to that speech and take heed that man has my respect his strength honesty and justice  he exudes 1908  is what other leaders lack
as long as wef elites are in play the people of the world will end up suffering
i will be investing a lot of money in argentina this year
who is john galt
if everyone is an entrepreneur who will work
can we move to argentina
why do these people all look so strange
i hope he and trump can make new trade agreements
too many jump cuts makes me wonder how much the original speech was changed
the wef elite does not give a damn about poverty for the common people as long as they have a good life wake up
it is ironic that billionaires want to be socialists
god protect the temple of this mans soul alot of people are going to want to damage it now he could be a problem for satans progress
shocked that the wef has allowed anyone to speak in opposition to the elites agenda
viva mileiviva la libertad carajo
the wef smeared through mass media and turned against trump after he was invited to speak and rather than praising globalism he stated america first members of wef are a tyrannical cult army 
this is an amazing speech
this man is explaining the split that is occurring on our planet this split is between those who want to take the lessons of history and shift in to the new world of prosperity and abundance as talked about in the speech or remain trapped and even regress into civil unrest by persisting with social programs and ideologies that do not and have never worked the fact we even have to debate this or discuss this in 2024 is mind boggling we are all faced with a choice at this critical juncture in time slavery or freedom  take your pick  this choice has been available to all of us since the dawn of time so its nothing new and was once reserved  for the privileged few however the rise of technology and conscious evolution means more and more people are awakening to this mighty truth
viva milei  el comunismo es una enfermedad
the wef believes regular people are the threat to the future especially people in rural areas
i generally agree with him but he omits completely the effect of energy the acceleration of growth coincides with
except when you cry and get bailed out  see the probalem
thank you   but lets not forget technology
wish he was able to run for us president
look forward to his speech 5 years later if he is still the president
this man speaks for the majority truth
wow we have all become so accustomed tothe globalist clap trap spouted to us for so long this almost bowled me overbravo
bless
no ways this is the best speech of the year
capitalism alone will only lead to tyranny and exploitation
based
excellent
he seems like a chill dude
they cut this video dont watch
everyone on the comments agreeing with him must also agree free enterprise must stand on their own any idea how much these  free capitalists  take in rd subsidies tax loopholes etc from our government while we pay for it from our taxes  have you ever wondered why we keep paying more in tax percentage while theirs is lowered  some corporations pay below col wages and openly instruct their employees to apply for food stamps and welfare they keep hours under 30 per week so they dont have to pay benefits who pays for the roads schools police firefighters etc so they can get those employees to their worksites  and we pay for their bailouts while they continue to receive 300 times their workers salaries bonuses and golden parachutes in the form of increased taxes for gods sake wake tf up
he will ruin argentina and become rich in the process once again a false prophet who will take advantage of the situation in the country
argentina is going from bad to worse dont cry for me
thats just exactly what i was thinking 
lizard
in the future corporations and government will merge into one praise google
beautiful
do not assume the wef wants capitalistic growth or the gdp to increase globally that would be a mistake many of them like the extreme poverty and hunger
what a great orator
free speech is limited here if you truly trust whats coming out the wef you are apart of the problem
hero
ahoy xavier
god bless you for speaking the truth  for you and all those that speak the truth know this god will protect you as he resists the proud  gives grace to the humble being bold thats what we need more people to be doing instead of being afraid we need to know that we are fighting fr a place of victory these people think theyre in control  theyve done a lot of evil however  theres only one person in control  thats jesus christ our lord  savior whether they believe in him or not  hes sitting in the heavens laughing  at all these globalists govt elites hollywood media who lie  propagate deceptive  divide people  to both start  fund every war where in   have ever been infact 1 trump is the only president who never started a war nor took a salary instead donated it facts are facts  truth is reality  opinions of people are irrelevant forever changing therefore not reality or truth god is exposing evil  i wouldnt want to be here through great 7 yr tribulation much less spend eternity burning in hell god gives us all free will were not robots so if they choose to do wicked they will reap what they sow fact 2 reality israel has always been a nation that belongs to the jewish people  theyve one every war bc gods hands upon them and they will never cease to exist so again good luck for the globalist they will fail miserably at this as always  i leave u w these facts undeniable truthproverbs 33135do not envy the oppressor and choose none of his ways for the perverse person is an abomination to the lord but his secret counsel is with the upright the curse of the lord is on the house of the wicked but he blesses the home of the just surely he scorns the scornful but gives grace to the humble the why shall in here at glory but shame shall be the legacy of fools jeremiah 31 36the descendants of israel will never stop being a nation that would happen only if i lost control of the sun moon stars and sea the lord says i will never reject the descendants of israelisaiah 313536 thus saith the lord which giveth the sun for a light by day and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar the lord of hosts is his name if those ordinances depart from before me saith the lord then the seed of israel also shall cease from being a nation before me foreverthe descendants of israel will never stop being a nation that would happen only if i lost control of the sun moon stars and sea the lord says i will never reject the descendants of israel
is he actually talking about the global gdp in the year 1500 how the hell you gonna have a gdp with people who are 6 inches tall
bravo mr millei people over the earth have for years more and more has free and we need to use our brain and hear what you offer not only argentina but every country
amen wake up people jesus i pray for opening of the eyes and your love and power which is the source of our blessings salvation for our families
fake
great speech saying what needs to be said
he didnt talk about the crime in his country
too bad the mexican president doesnt know english
this guy talks out of his ass
brilliant the complete opposite of what the wef want for us mere plebs
may god protect you sir
the best speech made in this wec 2024
thank you for posting this
bravo argentina
second devil
in capitalism money is the only thing it can make you free this is why capitalists like to say free world
bravo that man can i come and live in argentina please
im moving to argentina
this one of the most sophisticated and deceptive word salads any politician has ever uttered it wont take long say a couple of years to see if this economic policy succeeds or not in argentina i suspect it will not show short term benefits for the many and will lead to social unrest and massive brain drain emigration milei himself has already said the success of this path is decades away at what cost
no human trafficking is what all governments presenttar tar were freeindigenous were are freeno advanced civilizations appear anywhere on earth else psionics and free energy would be normalcome divinity cement your works into the divisions of ideas stagnant in the minds of men
dont be fooled  the imf loves him
someone should remind this psyco top 10 ranked countries in world are socialist swedendenmarknorway finland  iceland canadasince this psyco came to power inflation jumped by10 homelessness jumped by 5 i think he should have his head examined
capitalism can also be very cruel as communism but still preferable to a proven failed system southern america deserves to live in peace and prosperity
javier milei is my new hero one of the best presidents of our day and age its sad that the us system fosters candidates that are much too old orand stupid their european counterparts are not much better either its no wonder that putler along with sinoruzzia regarded us as weak
interesting i believe that this video is ai generated the lips keep repeating and there are glitches in several places during this video you cant believe many videos now sad  
was going to emigrate to the us but now im wanting to leave the uk with my family to go to argentina 
imagine getting a lecture on economics at a conference labeled world economic forum of course these corporate leaders are only interested in government taxation that will destroy their smaller competitors or prevent them from even forming
well it was nice knowing him now he is going to mysteriously get sick
absolute truth in the face of overwhelming corruption agendas and distortion how beautiful a thing the empirical
smart man
communism communism  communism communism communism  communismnot socialism
this version is cut to peices
i hope this man does good things for argentina i hope to move their eventually
wow they actually let him say all that
great speech 
free market capitalism will never be sustainable so by definition it will not last it will mean short term growth condemning future generations to a ecological disaster fuck it resource based economy is the global shift we need not more of the same
this guy typically mixes up the government and the economy  he implies that a capitalist government is better than a socialist government  he is conflating the free market with monopoly excusing the resulting concentration of wealth as a benefit to all  his libertarianism mixed with his neoliberal economics results in an oligarchical dictatorship like china where the population is doing better but there are few constraints on the rulers  russia is the end result of a capitalist oligarchical dictatorship where its populations standard of living is below that of india
whao
oilgasand electricity are the reason for our high standard of living not some monetary system
the real question is this will the wef realize the folly of its policies on its own or will the head of the snake have to be forcibly removed
i tried to watch the video but after about five minutes i had to stop its all chopped up its got all kinds of pieces missing numbers years all kind of things just skipped over
a breath of fresh air in the complete disgusting sewer which has been modern politics and ideas plain and simple you cant argue against data and history you can choose to be ignorant but dont believe for a second your modern theories actually work they dont facts speak for themselves
his praise of capitalism is noteworthy and i agree in the greatest part but he seems to ignore the dangers of unfettered capitalism capitalism should be well governed to be successful  the challenge is to find balance between regulation and the free market over regulation chokes the free market and unfettered capitalism takes advantage of labor disgracing the dignity of those that work the hardest and do the most dangerous jobs this is why labor movements are so important in the development of modern capitalism so i agree with his assessment of the benefits of capitalism but in part disagree with his criticism of regulation or what he calls collectivism
based is a person o_o
long live this argentine president for speaking truth to power amen
yesyes
poverty leads to unrest and rebellion
the ai freaks me out if its being translated by ai thats pretty cool but the ai editing his mouth to match the translation freaks me out seems legit because we know he supports a free market and capitalism
i totally agree with you as a selfemployed person who recently received an outsized tax bill being forced to give hard earned money to causes i dont support i havent wanted to work hard anymore
thankyou very much i pray your country stays on this path as we may end up immigrating
he is  us agent
so far the true hero of 21st century
this guy is on glue what we do have and what is destroying not only the planet directly and individual freedoms is crony capitalism a nation a world will not prosper when there is an unholy alliance between government and corporate influence
thank you god  commend sense still exists the god we the people have spoken this is a beautiful  song to our ears
lunatic
speaking at the world economic forum in sharing truth like that  i cannot believe this man was not tackled and drug off the stage by these crazy globalists  share this everywhere
hes quoting too many numbers and i cant relate
what a polar opposite from the corrupt failure president biden
i cannot believe they gave him time to speak and broadcasted it
we dont have free market capitalism  we have central bank debt printing and a monopoly of big corrporates held captive by larry fink and vanguardimfbisworld bank  i dont agree with what he says the only way to move forward is remove the central banksters
milei didnt kill himself
all i can say is that god bless this hero 
we need to return back to raw capitalism the adulterated model of capitalism we have right now is one that benefits the rich way too much government which of course happens to be bought off and used for filthy rich corporations despite the tax payer paying these people to represent the people
love this man i could not agree with javier milei more
well said sir please keep shining light thank you
some things more important than money like the planet for example cant buy a new one
wef is destroying the world in realtime
common sens and fearless
does this guy sitll alivehe goes against the narrative
this is if course nonsense successful societies depend on equality democracy and on human rights capitalism is the opposite of freedom and democracy it only makes the rich richer and the rest poor 
thank you for sharing the truth sir
stop government bailouts then
im tired of seeing the expression broke the internet used about anything its a stupid concept and its never happened its as valid as santa clausestoy harto de que se utilice la expresi√≥n ha roto internet para referirse a cualquier cosa es un concepto est√∫pido y nunca ha ocurrido es tan v√°lido como pap√° noel

viva free argentinian aqua viva argentinian futbollllllllllllllll
this should be a speech that reaches the entire world for centuries to come no man has made a more well researched well articulated statement in the wolds history the timing as well is impeccable i wish you good luck argentina embrace this idea you are capable of being the shining beacon in this world as opposing forces seek to dim the light of the united states
i thought this guy was a lunitac but nothing seems less true
bravo javier milei  if they let him this man may be able to save argentina from itself  he is a professor of econ√≥mics  the previous disastrous socialist government kept the populace quiet with handouts  he is so right  but the layabouts wont like him
it ai
it broke the internet because of the number of edits still i dont think k louse will in vite him anymore
the one world order of the wef is straight up of satan the feudal system resurrected by two classes of people the ruling and the enslaved the beast system   it must be rejected
i wonder what will happen when a man with political views of a 14 year old with too much internet gets to be in charge of a countryi guess only time will tell
bro you are europeans  u are not samerican impostors
javier didnt kill himself 
they let him give this speech does it not go against their religion
awesome to hear an opposing theory based from a historical point of view i strongly believe the manipulation  indoctrination in western societies is at  hadoken level  this poses a real problem in the search for the truth to our current problems the political arena has always been a breading ground for lies l toxicity  corruption that constantly points its failures on others
the question is how this man was even allowed to enter and give this speech
well said thank you
had enough of them schwab and company need shut down
finally a western head of state speaking truth to power and at the wef no less its time we all stood with leaders like javier milei against the neo communists who infest our respective governments and institutions a good place to start is at home canada
socialists are just the people in the school group project that didnt contribute but want the grade
it looks and feels like the usa citizens have been done dirty  from within  for generations  look around  sad end times
whzt wonderful speech youre  great sir  chapeau bas 
bravo 
the media in said western countries will paint this guy like he is trump even tho trump is not bad either thats how they demonize these good men
love the speech hope he can bring his country back from the brinki both love the technology to read the translation in his voice and am simultaneously terrified of the implications
great reality speech  the question is did he make it out of the building alive 
facts
where to free markets exist western market economics are built to cater to those who already own not to free markets
i dont know about argentina but by blaming western states with socialism and communism  only reflects how deep someones ignorance and delusion is i suggest them to read and do some research on what is socialism or communism analysing socialists or communist state system and their economic and political models then do comparision with every data obtained between socialism and with that western statesthose who are living in canada usa japan england germany you are experiencing the nirvana of high capitalism
this man will lead argentina into big trouble
free markets ftw 
the whole of europe also needs to listen and change their tune and sto following the us like a sheep
when truth true history evidence reality and common sense met in one speechcatedra
ok how you explain romania whit a 10 growth per year constant growth under sanctions and wass able to pay the external debtthe only nation that wass able to do that
wow everyone needs to see this
wait he speaks english and well why didnt he just speak in english during the tucker carlson interviewalso excellent speech
i get where hes coming from and mostly agree but capitalism is not the way the world needs an entirely new way of conducting business capitalism will help argentina yes but it has no bottom or top inflation should be grounds to demand removal of an administration or removal of ones ability to be a business owner
hi robin williams 
now lets see an american president today give a speech in another language
there should be a maximum amount of wealth a single person can have
its too bad the college kids who are being indoctronated in the us will not listen to this and think they are still right in their thinking
social justice for the ultra wealthy is fine apparently but destructive when its for the rest of us anyone who studies past civilizations can clearly see they used advanced technology so calm your male ego because we arent at the most advanced civilization please sir go build a pyramid if youre soooo advanced hes also ignoring the democratic part of the term democratic socialism these old people are just stuck in their own heads and refuse to accept the blending of isms sounds like a wealthy man scared his kingdom may crumble
this against sheldon whitehouse and jack reeds socialist marxist agenda they will shut you down
i applaud this gentleman for speaking up against the going narrative of other leaders to control it citizens with socialism i hope god protects him and keeps his family safe as well
it is clear that economic development has brought the human race out of poverty howeverthe end game of capitalism is slowly enslaving people and moving towards controlled poverty while threatening the planets ability to sustain comfortable life
abortion rights are important if a child is wanted it will receive a lot more care and cause less problems to society women that do go to abortion clinic do so by their own free will 1430
a new hope
this deluded type is exactly what is keeping true progress from arising but he wont have the last word argentina is a backwater capitalism is obsoleted and new societal models are underway class and castesystems are attached to capitalism and so is the unequal distribution the entire vision to it originates with feudalism capitalism is feudalism but more subtle and with the illusion of freedom to keep the masses distracted from its interior processes rewarding only a 1000 or less with excessives
this is just blind to the flaws of capitalism in places with unrestrained capitalism people are returning to poverty from middle class lifestyles gone are the days where it was feasible for a family on a normal income to own a house now even those with high income jobs have trouble finding places to live in the cities where they need to work unrestrained free market capitalism is tearing itself appart and pushing people to take action in the west what currently looks like is creating the best outcome is restrained free market capitalism as seen in the eu and especially the the scandinavian countriesbasically the flaw is that trickle down economics do not keep working and at some stage instead starts to have the inverse effect since at some point the persuit of profit generates tragedy of the commons effects where to generate more profit for one side it causes greater harm elsewhere at least initially just compariable to the effect of trickle down economics would have provided there an example of where it is not just restrained to negative effects on trickle down economics is in terms of climate change where a lot of economic activity have a more global negative impact causing huge losses that when accounting for the total value generated puts the actual generated net value way down part of the problem here is that these costs are elsewhere and paid over a long periode of time in the future so they have not showed up that much in historical data yet without some kind of intervension then it is not possible to handle such negative side effects or keep having the general population actually have increasing wealth generation as it comes down to issues like the tragedy of the commons where the effect on one self is much smaller than the total effect scewing the profit calculations
who let this guy on the stage cut his mic
i wouldnt trust any word that is spoken at the wef especially where schwab is in charge wef is and never has been working for us the 79 billion of us they exist only to control us and make the wealthy more wealthy and the ones controlling the world reach their goal to depopulate especially in their views good riddens to the elderly sick disabled overweight and the people who do not workproduce
cool speech now go implement your solutions in your own economy and lets see how it is by the end of your term you should take it one step further and stop free trade with all these elite countries to cripple them and see how your economy does prepare for 500 inflation
magic  time tyo stand up and be counted
 well said nations listen and learn please the elites dont want us to have freedom they want to control us
if this guy was truly for the people wef would not invite him to speak
awesme spwak bringing hope one thing  not one comment on here recieved a thumbs down that speaks volumes
si seulement on avait quelquun comme √ßa en france et pas le le tyran et traitre macron et ses sbires
mic drop  long live freedom damnit
this man is a true patriot leader congrats wish the us had this fire back our current weak sauce resident is bumping into walls like a defected roomba
communism was invented by central bankers thru print the money we pay interest on our own money
the elite who we dont know are throwing davos under the bus
great speech i dont like the stitching though
right on well said
brave to speak such words in front of demons
hey im more impressed about how well ai face mouth looks and fits words
viva la libertad carajo is javier mileis war cry with which he ends each of his public speeches what does carajo mean well carajo was the basket of the spanish caravels at the top of the mast where the lookout was located but also it was a place of punishment of penance and it was used as a threat do it again and youll go to the carajowhen trying to translate it into english it has become long live freedom damn or damn it which when retranslated into spanish becomes viva la libertad maldita sea but it does not reflect what is meant damn its not a curse it was the highest place on a ship at the top and around the mast and above the yards it is the place where the distances can be seen and from where the seeker warns the proximity of firm land or of a danger on the horizon in mileis case he uses carajo for emphasis using a word from lunfardo or slang from the town and not from the academywhen a sailors behavior displeased the captain he sent him to the carajo where he had to stand and without shelter from the wind and eventually the cold and the rain hence in the r√≠o de la plata argentina and uruguay carajo has an enormity of uses depending on the context of the sentence in this case it is a word that gives emphasis im telling you this for the last time carajo and it is used in very diverse ways  see dictionaries therefore it is very difficult to translate and it is better to leave it as is
fantastic wellargued and welldocumented speech which will make the speaker unacceptable to the majority of current politically correct western leaders in norway we are experiencing the negative effect of the globalists mismanagement
beware false heroes javier is a full on zionist the wef allowed him to speak and allowed us to see it they arent stupid but they know must of us are
as a canadian citizen i pray this message doesnt fall on deaf ears its so well spoken and the concepts brought forward are something i hope everyone can see were starting to fail in the past 5 years as a collective and governmentsocial repression have large parts to play here we can see money problems more prevalent everywhere each day even in prosperous families in the best countries and the better situations
the man had his free speech nice but his analysis is made and constructed by his own factsbut i would not call him dum hes is just unkwowing and at his age this is not a compliment
communism has consistently faced challenges in its implementation china asserts that its form of socialism rooted in collectivism has shown unique characteristics with just 20 years of economic growth it appears to be on a trajectory towards failure while capitalism is not flawless it stands out as the most successful market economy developed by humans  bob 
its kind of ironic that hes saying these things sponsored by the wef considering the wef wants the opposite of what he is saying 
that ai translation is too good almost scary
makes me wanna move to and invest in argentina  hope its not all just talk
finally  a guy that will makes us all rich and successfull all the academic economics should learn with him genius i just didnt like that he had to read so much  vegetable brain low wage workers really like to be poor
fake 
632todays world is freer richer more peaceful and more prosperous than ever beforekek
the ones booing are the enemies of humanity
great speech  reality check for these nazis who usually attend davos all by themselves
this a bonechilling topic to open a year
the solutions to the climate crisis and sdg goals kill more people than these problems
what is the exact free market capitalism   that he is talking about has it ever existed
this video is cut up a good bit cool speech tho
didnt know he spoke such good english
bs free market capitalist are given governmental funding from taxes all the time  they are not what they say imply to be  its just a dog whistle call for large corporations to say leave me the f alone dont try to regulate my output of pollution or worker abuse mean while small businesses could start up much easier with out the cost of health care and btw who will be taking out the trash and educating the students and who will pay for the this and the roads to be built
capitalism and socialism are two sides of the same coin too much of either without some sort of system to balance it is bad for a society capitalism just does a better job of sweeping its problems under the rug than socialism does
he has forgotten who the real freedom fighters arethe americans to think argentina is a world power is silly
we need men like this in america in politics
this dude deserves a nobel peace prize if he hasnt got one already he is so damn smart wow had a hard time keeping up with what he was saying but i got it but wow i had a posit make a comment because i needed a brain breather ok back to the showthis guy is good
i can think of many many people in governments to include their leaders who should be sitting in the front row excellente
this is ai generated propaganda
feel this is part of the hoodwinking feel like humanity is being played in a grim way and its deeper into samsarapeople reject their dharma believing in some way that it is a mythological idea yet samsara grows grows and growshow much does something inflate before it explodeslet it burn
my political vocabularys novice elementaryi didnt understand half the stuff
we have to look at more statistics than just the narrow window from which javier milei speaks a balance of both is what works no one system is perfect this is why we need to have a hybrid monetary system using the words free market capitalism is like a loose canon  it gives the idea that it is the only perfect system which it is not perfect thats like saying only one religion is perfect for the whole planet the reason that free market capitalism does well is because the process exploits workers though out the world and fmc exploits the environment for sure fmc pollutes the planet if we all had free medical health care then the businesses would not have to consider that cost when trying to start a new business venture we do not want the whole world operating in a more unjust and irresponsible way  we must consider all repercussions  most important to realize the capitalist free market are given governmental funds often   so the fmc are not financially successful all on their on
lets see how argentina can be saved 
bravo my friend 
was that respectful enough we have held that little thing come from telling me to be respectful once they respect life liberty in the pursuit of happiness
yeah what he said
gosh ai reading is super boring can someone program annunciation and inflection did it do his lips also amazing
bravo for him to point out the issues of the current political system  great speech from a great leader  good for argentina people
thank you for creating something like this for us
what is being said here seems to make a lot of sense i only hope that it can become a reality
mossad   be careful bro
the state is the problem  go argentina 
president javier milei god bless you and all of all of argentina i wish for you as i do the entire world eternal peace and prosperity
yeah but those are the exact people who wont listen
except the americas were not discovered in the 15th century or by cristobal colon columbus that would indeed be some news to the over 100 million people who were already living therehere at that time
looks fake but i love the message and hope its real
im british but hold no grudge for argentina i wish this man every success in turning his country around and turning argentina into a rich and happy country
congrats farzad to 1m views 
we have to many monopolies it has to be fixed  americas food and big pharma for example and other areas  bill gates and his plans on population control he needs to be investigated and prosecuted along with his allies 
capitalism and democracy should be intertwined yet the current scenario reveals an unregulated capitalism propelled ahead of democracy by globalized markets and ai this has disrupted traditional trade balances leading to disproportionate profits for a few while leaving 80 or more struggling while capitalism is beneficial it needs to be regulated to prevent it from spiralling out of control its worth noting that even the worlds wealthiest countries like america and china carry high debts raising questions about who truly benefits from the current system
the speech made me nauseous i kept nodding my head up and down
waw priceless left me speechless protect this guy
reading the comments makes me so sad for human progressthis guy is unhinged and spews lies he literaqlly misrepresents data to back up a twisted point his dog is his lead advisor hes converting to judaism as a pragmatic flavour of the month movement to back the israeli war in gaza he is literally following in the footsteps of fascist dictators throughout history some of what he says is true but he blames socialism for what is actually capitalist corruption within the executive branches of states and unionsgo do some reading people before you eat this stuff up
it takes a man some courage to speak the truth reality hurts and some cant take it
hear that  socialism doesnt work  america is a constitutional republic and if you want to change it get the hell out and taxes need to be fixed  too many taxes on americans
love to argentina from sweden
give that man a standing ovation
what a hero
excellent so true
a intellectual bomb has been dropped at the wef perfect place and time for this urgent message however this speech came together whoever helped with it and managed to get it out at this event has worked smart and hard everything that is true and that matters has been clarified and finally voiced to a world wide audienceit appears that the wef has just experienced a reality check is this the urgently needed point of return the wind of change experienced at this event i so much hope soand how did mr klaus schwab take it i dont know where to put him since i became aware of his socialist painted past anyway bravo javier milei
one of my favorite speeches ive ever heard thank you for the translation
yes but also a fairytale you can have infinite global economic growth if we had access to infinite resources obviously we dont
nailed it capitalism gives a chance for many to become wealthy  not just a monarch or some fundamentalist at the top of the ponzi pyramid  socialism and communism have no place for the poor and disabled  thats the lie of those ideologies  also if you put in no effort you do not deserve a reward especially from others who did  social welfare should be a hand up when you are down not a lifestyle  thats the point too  it was never supposed to be a lifestyle and to his point some world leaders want that class system  thats open borders and globalism  aka communism
it looks to me that all the billionaires  huge millionaires of this world are working for someone else other than their bloodline as they have secured wealth for 45 bloodlines and their offsprings without even raising a rockso the only thing thats left now after knowing the rich  richer and the poor poorer quote is to let us know what they are using the wealth for or for whom
does anyone seriously think this guy is going to fix argentinas economy
this is a wise leader  so glad he had a chance to share this 
this guy is singlehandedly going to destroy argentina
this is the president who refused an invitation to join bricks and is intentionally sabotaging trade relations with argentinas largest trading partner brazil no exactly a rational voice in the wilderness 
ai is that you
we dont need the wef
we dont need the wef
you sure this guy is a politician

 this guy is just a shameless and willfully ignorant cheerleader of a dying system that might kill us allutterly ludicrous comments
el peluca sabe
thats all nice and fine but why is he in the wef his position is not a secret and it does not allign with the plans of the wef why do they give him a voicemakes me wonder if he is also just an actor in this puppet play we are seeing on the world stage
do any citizens actually support wef
the growth rate in year 0 xd wtf
thank you need more and more of this push back
was making a lot of sense talking up freedom until it got to abortion where apparently more freedom is bad cognitive dissonance is prevalent in all walks of life
mr xavier you said it allgod bless you
well we were in economic prosperity here in the us until biden got placed in the white house  i have watched my paycheck shrink a lot in the last 4 years   biden is one of these wef goons  get him out of there
wow argentina one of the few real western countries left

mitsotakis  lessons to learn  listen to him not to others people in greece they very unhappy with you people cant function because your economic systembabys milk 200 higher then others europe s nations why what is the reasonare you controlling the birth of greek babies
the eu americanato and the wef are the most dangerous institutions in the world they are drawing more and more power to themselves they are increasingly setting the rulesthe identity of each individual country and each individual is lost in the countriesthey cause unrest and instability in the eu countriesthe eu only causes all the misery in the worldthe european central bank that keeps printing money indefinitely and influencing interest ratesenough is enoughthe people have the power the cabinet and the eu is in the service of the people the people can also choose to dismiss the cabinet if the cabinet malfunctionspoliticians should serve the people and realize that they are in the service of the peoplepoliticians should not conduct backroom politics politics should be separate from multinationals and other shady clubs
the globalist liars are getting exposed
the globalists are running scared their lies corruption and censorship are getting exposed
brilliant speech thank you farzad for sharing this speech given by the argentinas president during the world economic forum greetings from madang papua new guinea
are you kidding me they want this nwo
sadly made by ai
interesting one more paid puppet that tells us1 the west is socialist but not by the common definition of socialism but by his own2 capitalism is good because it took more than 90 of the worlds population out of poverty by the way that isnt true according to pip the percent of people under the poverty line worldwide  was 378 in the 90s and only went under 10 in 2017 if you will also look at the whole graph youll see that the poverty actually went and still goes down in time of the evil socialism3 monopoly is good that one is actually based on the second argument or on the premise that capitalism is unconditionally good for the people that should in his opinion tell us that stopping monopolies is bad for the economy and therefore also for the people well at one point it may be true but there are and have been enough examples of monopolists working against healthy concurrence and therefore against the free market or there are examples of monopolists straight up harming people like the nestles infant formula incidenthe is obviously not calling for the educated people out there and there is a reason for it
quit with the fake videos
nice speech but dont be fooled by these supposedly  saviors  trump and milei are puppets of the zionist elite 
i would have liked to watch his speech but alas then internet was broken waiting for atlas ayn rand and john galt to fix it because i am a willless peasant myself
wow just got educated right there in under 20 minutes mordern day aquiescense explanined
here in america the states have taken over county after county 
huh like 1 speech is going to change anything things will only get worse hit a boiling point  blow into all of our faces
the voice of reason from wef is something im not familiar with but starting listening to more often lately gives me hope in the humans in general
watch for how long he gonna be fine im sure the world elite didnt like it the antichrist probably will plan soon somethg to happen to this smart kind individuell
invite this guy to talk to our politicians asap
the claim that people have it better under capitalism starting in the 1800s is a lie no people did not enjoy better times under the beginning of the industrial revolution in fact working in big factories was much worse than working in agriculture no capitalism is not an inherently better system for the everyday man it does create wealth but there is no written rule as to how that wealth is to be distributed collectivism isnt any better since governments can fuck you over as well this is populism fuck the wef sure but embracing even more freemarket values will not magically solve all of our problems
damn this guy is good for that country
honestly as a french our country went downhill the moment we started to go down the path of liberalism and let foreign companies taking overwe used to be an ultra socialist country and it was working fine we stop nationalise our big companies to make them go private just for them to get destroyed by americans and germansnationalism works if the governement is good otherwise it goes sour pretty quick
how many times the video has been cutyou can clearly see that the sentences in the video were cutlook the guy face and the frame diff
thank you
amen tell em man long live truth
truth will  prevail in all areas we the people are the heroes of this planet we have to come together and remember we are all family if we work together and make sure everyone has what they need and clean  this planet up how much better it would  be for all here wow think about it
but those greedy guts at daves don t want to hear this do they this guy is spot onwell puthe is rightover here in  the us we are in trouble from demented greedy monsters
one thing he is wrong onsocialism works perfectly fineit works exactly as intended
hes obviously phony or compromised because the us wouldnt let him get into power unless it benefited us
i can lip read and he is speaking in english not spanish
711 
oh my i hope everyone on earth sees this
its a shame the only ones who hear this speech and understands these words are those of us who already know these facts it would be interesting to now hear the other sides rebuttal
never trust anyone who says everything you want to hear
power to the people
what values are you talking about ooh by killing more than 20000 children in gaza those are western values by trying to overthrow russia
milei is the leopard asking you to let him eat your face if only youll believe him that capitalism doesnt kill
i remember when trump did the same thing and put everyone on noticenext thing u know countires started paying their fair share and no longer taking advantage of the united statesthen biden came along anf fked it all upquickly too
why is he speaking at davos who are well known that they are elite globalists
a company is a form of collectivism   success is not simply a measure of a superior product   and most importantly gdp is not calculated with the environmental cost  the growth in gdp over the last hundreds of years was a largely due to an exchange of environment well being to human development  but the environmental cost needs to be accounted for otherwise we will all be spending more to survive in the harsh environment we create  not smart
the problems with capitalism are the lopsidedness of wealth collection and its reliance on constant growth on a finite planet just because something has worked in the past doesnt mean we should stick with it forever and not try to find better ways automation is going to bring about the necessity for certain changes a humans worth will no longer be tied to the amount they contribute to the market im not saying i like the way things are but unbound capitalism will eventually lead to a different type of totalitarianism we are already well on our way in america in particular it all started as or at least we are told for the people by the people but now its by and for the rich meanwhile people are willing to give up freedoms as long as it only foreseeably negatively affects those we dont agree with
from what i have seen and heard of him he is the type of man that inspires others a necessary quality in a world where the most obvious are the overinflated egocentrics and the self deprecating defeatists a world in which whole nations are shooting themselves in the feet
i dont think unchecked capitalism is the answer having ultrarich businessmen run the world is no better than having dictators run the worldi can agree that our current model of quasi socialism isnt working though many people feel cheated right now see my home country of canada
amazing
my internet still works good speech though
black lives matter
the man is knowledgeable
it wasnt the adoption of capitalism that drove explosive growth  it was energy  fossil fuels  unfortunately this is unsustainable
how does this speech break the internet here pal ill break the internet the one piece the one peice is real if you know then you know
my niqqa
neither system is better on its own capitalism in order to work needs some socialism aspects to balance things out to make sustainable economy
this damn clip is edited from start to finish therefore i see it as half bullsht
beautifully said 
i still consider the wef as my enemyprove it to me first words are just words and they dont mean a thing without the proper backing of those wordspromises are easily made and broken when it doesnt fit someones hidden agenda
it is interesting how right the right are
the problem with the elites of the sort that mingle at davos is that they truly believe its their divine right to rule and set the rules above and beyond anything else what they utterly neglect to understand to put it in the way of the oracle in the matrix the equation is always attempting to equal itself in their blind approach for total control and dominance they are ignoring the fact that the more they try to get their way the stronger the collective force thats pushing against its like trying to stop the seeds from growing by putting pavement on top eventually even the pavement gives way and the seed sprouts these people are not only danger to the mankind overall they are even danger to themselves because they have absolutely no idea what they are doing
the whole agenda for this davos meeting was to win back trust  take this with a pinch of salt action not words i dont see any of their ideas being retracted
cosplaying as hayek in 2024 thats retro except argentina in 2024 is nowhere near 1944 britain in terms of its status in the global hierarchy in fact its nowhere near britain today despite the latters decline also to attribute the fruits of development of the past 200 years to only free enterprise capitalism or free trade capitalism would be a gross generalisation his hair looks fun tho anyway words are best backed up by actions meaningful actions so let us see how argentina will do in the next four years under his leadership
the state is not the solution the state is the problem  he couldnt have summarized better
this must be a joke the argentinian president leading the world economic forum 
i did not enjoy the way this video was edited respectfully
there are a few tuttle twins episodes that say the same thing
rarely i had the opportunity to hear grater aberrations and inadequacies than in this discourse its shocking that what exactly brought us in this mess neoliberalism as a global schema of economics and politics is considered to be the solution are you for real
finally someone who dares to tell the truth face to face
there is no such thing as a free market capitalism there are a handful of media outlets that run the news theres a handful of oil companies that run the industry theres a handful of supermarkets that run the groceries markets essentially all small businesses are being wiped out and being replaced by afew big wigs so what hes saying is that capitalism is a model to followcapitalism that led to two world wars that led to invasions of iraq and syria and palestine
1 allowing the market to regulate itself is the reason why economic inequalities and monopolies exist 2 if socialism has killed 100 million people how many has capitalism killed3 the economist that coined gdp even said it was not supposed to be used as a metric of a countrys success  only the tracking of its spending4 if the state hadnt been pressured through advocacy then intervened to promote womens rights through legislation theyd still be barefoot and pregnant treated as private property5 capitalisms philosophy revolves around profit exponential  unrestrained profit motives will continually push those already poor and disadvantaged into further poverty having less and less of the cake he speaks of6 if the state hadnt intervened in the west with social welfare the poor would be dead 7 libertarianism is vehemently opposed to state intervention so if we allow free market corporations to have unfettered action in the economy how do we tackle climate change we got to this  point in history because of capitalism and the push for exponential profit gain corporations already have such a strangle hold on policy development which has seen price gouging wars for resources and the plundering of underdeveloped countries for the benefit of share holders8 this speech while articulate and has some good points is myopic narrow minded and ideologically opposed to the true freedom and liberation of all peoples by promoting profits over people no change to the status quo more of an enhancing of it under the guise of libertarianism
capitalism is way for enrichment  small asterisk for the few and complete poverty and collapse for the rest
why did schwab let this speech happen  something stinks here whats the wef  un upto
i see where he is going at and i think we can agree that socialism or actually its real world implementations were bad the main problem though was that those implementations were not about bringing justice or equality to the people stalin mao kim and the likes never intended build a better world they just acted in self interested to rule as almighty tyrants creating oppressive and corrupt regimeswe dont have to look at one extreme on the scale that is socialism we also dont automatically have to choose the other extreme that being vulture capitalisminstead we should look towards creating a free market capitalism that is governed regulated and guided to serve the peopleit makes no sense to regulate absolutely everything because those would kill off any creativity and growth but areas like water supply infrastructure healthcare education should be accessible to everyone in need and affordable manner free market capitalism american style does not ensure that at all in contrary actually in the social democratic countries of europe we have found a nice place in between those two extremesfree market but with certain ecological and social responsibilities enforced by the state the implementation of those rules are up to the market playersits not perfect i admit that but it combines the best parts of both worlds eventually leasing to less corruption less poverty less inequality less violence
this is a great speech  im going to find the transcriptfor inspiration and reference in the future
wow
the best president i have voted for my country vamos argentina 
pushing the world bank agenda is he stock in the 1980s the world has change this he is crazy no one is pushing communism or socialism is a tactic  used by the west to scare the people to apply their enrich tactics on the rest of the world
argentina
i hope he save argentina  what he say is absolutely correct 
bullshit
congrats argentina 
yeah the rich are richer but all of the little guys are getting squeezed out because everyone is raising prices for the greed of itprivate real estate investments is the major cause of extreme inflation on housing the largest monthly cost for the average person
i am so glad that this commonsense intellectual actually made it to become president a miracle being such a flamboyant character i do wonder why he chose to read his political theory from a script he is a wonderfully gifted speaker who can rally tremendous support for his ideas is it because he is speaking to a largely hostile audience
hear hear
this man needs to be protected  thank you argentina  for voting in a real leader and supporting freedom now us americans will do our part and vote in trump  and thank you netherlands for voting in gert  maga is a movement
oh dont get it twisted there is no well wishers no good intentions they know their plan and are executing it well not for long though the sleeping giant has been awakened
argentinia and finances well never woked so well
capitalism has its flaws too the fact he is so unwilling to discuss that and dissect that well  scares me and makes me suspect he may just be another bad actor forgetting some lines and rhetoric
great speech truer words have not been spoken   it is a relief to know that there is a place we can go if we fail to right the ship here in the good old usa
whats annoying is how people take him word for word and run with it  bro like what hes saying youre aloud to like hearing what youre hearing but to assume its 100 factual is why we continue to bicker like utter idiots good on you all for adding to that mess 
is this ai or real
i dont disagree with a lot hes saying except when it comes to marxism or socializing or some of my own ideas i wouldnt call socialist ideas at all but some others might 
did he also give this speech i english i saw it in spanish
incredible speech
how stupid are most of the commentators believing that this is an antiwestern discours 
interesting but if this is completely correct then why after reagan following neoliberalism financial advice eliminated regulations for corporations etc did the wealth gap widen and people became poorer there needs to be a debate between economists
this man should be on everys country news broadcasted but ofcourse they donti vote for him as president of america maybe then this world will know peace
moving to argentina
is the original cut up like this at all with those little glitches
i think capitalist need a law to control so one person cant just dominate the whole field and no one can compete
wow this guy gets it
brawo polska nie da siƒô chorym ideologiom i globalistom
i meet javier milei and had a long conversatioin at a dinner en buenos aires a coupple of years ago and i learned that he is just a man that has no greed or need for money or power he is doing this just because he thinks that is the right thing to do
wow what a speech wowlets see what the other countries think of what they are sayingin england we are going down the drain i am 70 god help all you lot that are younger then meyou lot need to stop all this shit that is  happing in england
this man is a treasure
milei with a bang
the moment we are at our richest and healthiest was the 60s  80s during the industrial revolution today we are at a decline things are still okay but most people cant afford a living and go in to dept hes right about most things but not about that we are richest today perhaps the elites are but not the people it would be very difficult to go back to those days it would mean moving away from automization and lets face it these gen z are not going to be happy about that what we need is in an entirely new system to deal with this modern climate once ai replaces most jobs itll be the end of the economy as weve known it
just to remind you the economic uprise and prosperity of the 30 post ww2 years was achieved through keynesianistic policies the downfall of western society as we know it today was created by market liberalisation and neoliberalism chiles autocracy was also brought by milton friedman
yes i agree not a popular philosophy for decades but it is the reality that doesnt mean it is uncaring i hope argentina is brave enough to give it a go and return to prosperity
fake
the state is not the solution it is the problem itself
disgusting
this guy is a puppet of the people hes supposedly criticizing  we the brainwashed masses are supposed to be told the truth by those who enslave us  hes their mouthpiece right now
i am afraid something might happen to silence this poor man he is not a team playerhe speaks the truth too rightfully
finally a world class speech
thanks sadly cant see the transcript of mileis speech
i love this guy
ok so gotta move to argentina but they say i gotta get the jab to emmigrate 
the best definition of the problems we have in europe and in the whole world now western world countries and and their leaders have fogoten western values individualism private property freedom of actions freedom of speach free market laws that apply to everyone even goverment and parlament persons and presidents state leaders now i congratulate argentina and their leaders you have found that western world have lost i hope europe leaders will waik up and listen to your words thank you for your courage to say such words in davos a forum of extreem leftists
love this man and the fact he has the cajones to speak truth right to the anyones face that needs to hear it  bravo javier
i also say that this and the last 70 year wear probably the best time for the most of human timei almost can not see a future with clever mind people making live more beatiful each datthe system seems rotten but statistics show what he says  but fraud is a big issue with money housing nature  art and bitcoins
good man
oh bravo well thought out and based on facts not models or pinion with selfinterest
i just want to keep pressing the thumbs up button 
argentina is now officially open for business 
yeah biitches
will ceo listen to this  milei tells this forum and world leaders how big clowns they are and how far they are from  the real world  wef have here a breath from the reality
the secret to a perfect society is in the nordic countries perfection
this is superman i am gobsmacked at his understanding and undeniable courage in putting his ideas forward to the corrupt leaders at davos
its ai lads 
check 2008 crisis why was there bail outwhy did they bail out the rich that is communismhe is naive
brave and moral man to speak his truth apart from leaders at wef
ohh noo its soo sad he commited sue em and cide even though he was drving a car in a crowd and no gun was found at the scene
thank you mr president
how long till this mans spirit breaks the system cannot be defeated by just a man we need our king our lord and saviour jesus christ                         
how can anyone think what he is saying make sense or is going to help end world hunger
i vote for this guy to be the us president
why has it been chopped up so much there are words missing
is he related to benjamin franklin they look alike lol even though i have never seen either
this man is absolutely amazing and deserves to be argentina president
does anyone else think that this man looks like bilbo baggins
wow what an excellent and profound analysis of economic development socialism has created chaos and poverty in our human communities venezuela is the current basket case of the demise of socialism
good cop 
gives me hope 
money sparks jealousy  and destroys trust never trust a rich man he has trod on poor people to get there
growth growth growth  lets just destroy everything   money is not the answer ending greed is
thank you for not only taking the time to produce this in ai but also labelling it as such those type of values should underpin your organisation and bring you extreme fortune and success
it was deliberately done to regain and rebuild trust remember what the theme was it is part of their plan never trust terrorists this is proof of it they are playing us
el fue profesor universitario de econom√≠a por 15 a√±os  los medios no dicen esto
well said milei
he is in the club i dont buy iot what a very new way to solve problems take from the poor once again and the people are ignorant enough to buy into it probably tapping each others shoulders behind the scenes the whole strong leader bs over and over again
i wonder why he was allowed to speak
he actually said that globalists are nazis at the wef 
i dont trust him theyll say anything to get sheeps to stay in line id much prefer to see action
the new argentina president sounds like a outoftouch smalltown college political science professor i dont expect argentina going anywhere during his term
this argentinian leader is elected the arrogant bunch in the audience unelected self appointed spokesmen for their rich powerful masterswe people of the world dont need
a govt agency and a company existing on govt contracts or services are  different only in name  companies that get funding through govt contracts are essentially tax funded  and companies that are politically connected and  eliminating competition through laws to create artificial demand is both funded in physical resources indirectly and abstract services they both are the same as state ownership of production as state ownership  state fundingsupport in services and resources and the resulting state monopoly
this is powerful this man spoke the truth and the people of all these western countries might hopefully see that the politicians and the government are not on their side but instead only watch out for their own selfish interests unfortunately the widespread infiltration of garbage economics doctrine in academia doesnt help one single bitfree market capitalism is the only way out of poverty and into prosperity
i wonder if he would go to the barrios of argentina and give this speech 
why is austin powers 1960s boss giving a speech at wef
blah blahnothing will change
these elites will starve and freeze the middle class and the poor under the altruistic guise of climate change equity and cosmic justice as thomas sowell calls it socialism in general has a record of failure so blatant only an intellectual could ignore or evade it thomas sowell to all the disingenuous advocates of socialism who respond with the same tired nonsensical response communism hasnt been tried before or the other classic deflection that wasnt real socialism i say this it doesnt matter if it wasnt communism or socialsm it matters that it was sold to the people that it was going to be so never judge policy based on the intent judge them by results remember f a hayek  fascism is the stage reached after communism has proved an illusion
protect this man before he has an accident
amazing
as a brit from england  i agree with him
exactly all points well made
why all the cuts
thats basically a middle finger
god bless argentina god bless america god bless the west sic semper tyrannis
no such thing as a free market never has existed and never will stop touting it capitalism may work but free markets are a fantasy what raised people out of poverty was advances in technology and medicine this is a shile for the elite
amen  the wef must be dismantled and locked up
austin powers yeah baby yeaaaah
hes telling the elites that the peoples needs are the most important not theirs
long live freedom
he is absolutely right power and wealth should be concentrated in the hands of a few multinational corporations with deep ties to nonelected political government institutions
old news  capitalism is good and bad we are hearing the good from this guy and nothing about the bad  good luck with whatever change you choose
well said
but why cut out the dates
congratulations argentina on electing the best leader on this planet he absolutely destroyed the globalist socialist agenda from inside the belly of the wef beast itself argentinians must be patient with melei as he is trying to clean up nearly 100 years of socialist chaos and destruction and this may take a generation or two to complete the transformation australia elected a radical socialist government 18 months ago and the damage in such a short time is immense australians now realise their mistake and are fighting back hard to defeat a radical leftist government that lied its way into office socialists always sound compassionate sincere and humane but their actions tell the truth of the beasts they are biden is living proof of how a once great power can be destroyed so quickly because of socialist idealogical that never works no matter what it is called
seems to be some clipping and editing on this video 
secretary  how rightwing would you please for the davos gigjavier  unappologetically uncollectively yes
bullshit
what about how demand can be completely manufactured by social engineering on the end of supply if the market is a truth teller then why does it constantly lie to itselfits not like we live in an informational era where goods and services are marketed mainly through their tobeperceived cultural relevance instead of more objective criteria buy x and youll look good in front of y is what drives revenue today and what we see in ads where the fuck do you process any semblance of an objective and sane demand in thisif a market that cares most about selling smartphones absolutely nobody wanted anything to do with twenty years ago does not carry ideological bias then call me a socialist alrighta free market isnt a catalyst for changes in consumption models its a catalyst for concentration in consumption models it takes whatever the fuck works to generate transactions at the moment and forms obsessions even bubbles around it this is not an expression of objective demand meeting objective supply this is just an expression of collective crazewhen was the last fucking time the markets went insane over delivering quality and quantities of innovative food products yet this is the pillar of us as a species we need to eat but the markets and their marketers dont give a flying fuck about food whilst the average everyday man does give a fuck about it when were the markets lastly crazed over concerns of making housing better when were the markets lastly obsessed over making clothing durable and easy to wash over stimulating our innate need for cultural status through buy and dump fashionso why isnt supply meeting demand there huh is it socialism again doing shady work or is it the markets failing to account for reasonable needs favouring whatever stimulates our need for social recognition insteadthis is where libertarianism is blindsided it acts as if were reasonable measured consumers were not we can be engineered to buy anything given enough investment for such engineering to work privately funded researchers just need to find out about any loophole in our biologypsychology and boom marketers have new means of creating demand over goods and services that are secondary at best to our most important needs tell me right in the eyes that goddamn social attention addictions are expressions of objective and sane demands that markets ought to satisfy with totally essential products such as tik tok and twitterif we are to be so sure about the objective causality between what we want and buy and are compelled to buy and what we actually need to be happy then how the hell do hippies get along and happy with how bare and unorthodox their consuming habits arehow do people willingly refuse to be part of market trends and still live happilyare there ghosts in javiers machine
he is right the west is decaying under progressive rot
i hope the wef elites learn from this eye opening speech and do something better not only for themselves but for the entire whole world to be a better place to live god help us 
great speech siri
horrah  for this man
im moving to argentina
musks wealth is chump change to the ones who control the narrative and own everything clowns
so to the pointunfortunately the so called leftist elite is tone deaf to reality  and think that climate change is new it is happening for thousands of years  we have had ice times and tropical woods in what is now temperated  the middel east has been one big rain forrest  hence the big deposits of carbon energy  mammoets have been grazing on the bottom of the nord sea yet they think draconian laws killing every initiative is saving the world from what has been changing from the beginning of this world
ai is great technology if used responsibly but we know it wont be the power it has given those who rule this worldscary
epic speech  in the us we want to ask milei to run for president instead of trump and biden
capitalism is also the only economic system that works handinhand with individual human rights thats why all the western democracies are capitalist thats something thats often not discussed
aside from the intent of the creator and content of this video what worries me is this video was produced with ai not only translating the speech but also lipsyncing it  it is very convincing the potential for abuse of this technology alone is worrying  we are in a time when we can create visual evidence of anyone saying anything quite convincingly believe nothing you hear and only half of what you see
so glad the worlds changing their leaders this leftist disaster has run its course and the majority of us have had enough
imagine the collective oh sht that rippled through the audience
that was a very powerful speech one the socialist wont be happy with
thank you for mentioning this is speech is his and is ai modified for language
god bless and protect this man
how dare he speak in such a manner  we cant have an economist as a president who knows his subject and is able to understand and articulate his arguments we want to hear sheep bleating the current neo marxist narrative now watch them try to crush him

the hero we needed but dont deserve
disgusting perspective pushing right wing extremism as the norm that listeners are supposed to agree with like he presents this like its common sense and norm its pushing a system of bullies winning and destroying the world anyone they can win over and being happy about it the thing that increased population and quality of life is technology not competitive selfishness

this new world of the 18th century has run its course it is time for the order of this old new world till 300 years pass at which time a reset must occur every 300 years as the life spans and memories wane hastening the ability to avoid detection
except for a bit of religious sauce on top it felt like listening to ayn rand 
words have no meaning for a bank and the state such as the criminal justice system the medical health care system and everything else related to power its all a big bank its all about money its not about justice not about politics not about health care its about maximizing profits at all costs  and we are doomed to greed
we need men like him in australia

muslims part in wef is zero ya allah help us
this fake chopped up video is going to be reported as false information play the video in whole otherwise you are notified that you will receive the propaganda award for bs and lies
dangerous speech that sounds nice but has an underlying agenda of controlling freedom by cutting choices built on freedom of choice capitalism is the best modern method to build a fairer society but when there are checks and balances javiar is essentially saying to stop helping those in need that to help the poor it has to be done by any country raising its higher wealth level and that will help the poor in those countriesthe problem is that if there is no incentive for those with money be they the rich individuals or corporations to help the poor by building better teaching schools health organizations and and the arts  music then humanity as a whole will lower there worth as you are seeing now in where the farther the lowermiddle classes are from the higher classes the more unstable the economy society becomes viva la libertad  para el carajo los que esconden sus agendas detr√°s de bonitas palabras sonoraspeace

the trouble with socialism is that eventually you run out of other peoples money margaret thatchers great speech bravo
another clown high priest of capitalism as the solution of all problems lies upon lies but people are gullible and we know that
i can imagine schwab soldered to the toilet crapping nonstop while milei was speaking and asking every ten seconds he finished yet can i clean up and leave already
long live freedom damn it
a worthy worldglobal leader

finally someone came to tell us the truth socialism and communism are the cancer of our society it is time to take action
i notes to cut off some of video as well
well said wish america had a real men a real leader
glitchy ai  understood important points conventionally argued by most neoliberals 101 im sure the economists in the audience were dozing but he forgot one point neoclassical gains have come at the great cost of demolition of many essential planetary life support systems most every environmental indicator is red lining whether the neoliberals notice or not so as long as we can survive without a functioning planet he makes some good points but if we need this planet to be life sustaining he missed the boat
brilliant south africa  needs a president like this
this is the best speech i have heard in years  this man is brilliant and dead on   cheers milei
with this guy as president argentina has a chance for tomorrow 
he causes all both small and great rich and poor free and slave to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads 17 and that no one may buy or sell except one who has athe mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name
awesome thats right  thats right  thats right  im an american living as a missionary wife in the philippines   the philippines is a third world country but we have seen in the last 20 years we have been here they are progressing with hard work and freedom   they are willing to work in every nation just for their families back home to have an education  surely if the philippines  try to control their people they would be a downtrodden society but instead they are a happy  sweet  hardworking people  we thank god for freedom here so that they can choose what they do where they live and where they go to school
thank u mister presidente from cali commie state since 2010
doesnt anyone  else find it strange that he should have been allowed to give this speech in this forum  whilst i agree with what he says i do not trust him or the wef one bit
politicians like him straightforward honest good people above all should be the only type of politicians that exist in this worldthe left hates this man theyre afraid of honesty theyre afraid of democracy theyre afraid of the truth
i wish we had republicans strong as millie
love this guyplease come to canada and be our leader
it used to be normal thinking in 7080snow after globalists took over they will call him fascist more and more  of your income will go to the statewhat a  bs
where do i buy my argentina stocks
collectivism isnt stopping the cartel or any mafias neither is keeping poor countries poor it greedily syphon their exportswhats the point of this speech to argue that its ethically right lmao
avarice personified
at what cost to humanity is humanity free
thank you mr milei for your balls to say nothing but the truth this speech is priceless
in other words go woke go broke
javier milei is the best man walking this earth well as well as donald trump
take note regressives
everyone person on earth has the free right to have food water housing clothing by our creator and should not cost a cent money is man made humans follow unstable leaders  just saying 
dont you know youre not allowed to say those kind of things praying for your safety dont forget to wear your bullet proof underwear

epic well done sir
this guy is right on he gets it he knows socialism is a failure everywhere  good luck sir in argentina maybe the united states will take heed
i dont care what people say about this guy he means well first the argentenians
please remember that this years meeting is titled restoring trust that means theyll tell us anything that sounds good so it could be a trapbut nevertheless i must say clearly that this is one of the most excellent speeches i have ever heard on this subject this speech should be shown several times on television at prime time
finally someone speaking truth
   great leader congratulations argentina 
satanists in that audience most of them by the way will not listen to him because of their lust for power
its about time for the quiet majority speaks out
thank you 
keep this president in prayers as the satanic system will be upset for this president not going with the wef agenda
brilliant  well said sir at last a politician who is a leader and comands respect
anyone want to take bets on how long he survives this
listened to 30 of his child like capitalist nonsense  example citizens of free countries live 30 longer well that ratio has dropped a big wack for the gowing poor living in tent cities and the others are kept poor and destitute sanctioned so the west can loot their resources
finally someone with an education gets to speak
if capitalism will effectively reduce poverty and increase freedom im all for it my question is how will it do so and how will we ensure that doubling world gdp will benefit everyone it so often seems that the majority of the increases in wealth are retained in the hands of a few people multibillion dollar companies like amazon generate massive wealth for the small number owners and top leadership and very little for the large numbers of wage earners by all means show me i am not taken by any ideological system of thought i go to work almost every day and what i see is huge rewards for business owners top leadership and investors and small rewards for wage earners many of whom have large debts i dont know what the answer is but i dont see a bright future for the majority of the wage earners i work with by all means please explain to me how this will actually benefit people other than the already wealthy this is not a complaint it is an actual question i hear all these speeches by people on the left and right pro and anti capitalism  pro this system anti that system and they all say the same thing our way will eliminate poverty and increase wealth well how how will it increase my personal wages how will it directly increase the income and standard of my friends and family
i love javier milei
wow someone talking commonsense  thank you  very much
they let them say these things because they feel so strong about what they are doing the best thing to do is to face it head onthis is what they will do and eventually as much as i dont want to admit it nor do i want to see it they will win its written the only thing we can do is slow it down
f
why do his lips seem to match the english did ai alter this also
bravo
i must pay kudos and courage to the speech writer as well as the president great speech
this is a wonderful true and to the point message god bless this brave argentinian president god bless you and god bless argentina and all who love democracy and capitalism
we need adaptive policies and quite trying to force reality into just one system
this also applies for that negligent mexican president amlo the guy is crazy its a con artist who is nothing but acting like he is developing the country with new train system and mickey mouse benefits he could never finish the criminal activity of organized crime and cartels leading the country mexico needs true democracy and kick the socialism out of every single latin american country
i love this guy
neoliberalism has crumble the worl milei is a just another  clown of it
wow
hes controlled opposition this guy is not o my loyal to israel he also is in favor of weird things such as polyamory 
as a leader i dont get his point mumbo jumbo i think collectivism is china and north korea not the west this was russia under stalin collective farms this was a totalitarian system who is he talking about
epic 
the market is the failure of all man kind infinite growth on a finite planet is what the market represents
he basically told the culprits what their strategies are and exposed them at their own meeting i hope they wont be able to silence him
blah blah jew
wow he nailed it so eloquently across the board no emotional anger no strawmans very straightforward nuanced stance on the state of how socialism destroys societies how its being pushed in different cultural aspects today ahnd particularly what we should do in resisting it 
this man is a rare political hero
these problems are being  created not for control but so the antichrist can fix the problems he created
wow absolutely stunning  thank you finally a real human in politics  bless you and your message 
hes another giorgia meloni  gives brave impassioned speeches filled with the traditional values and will of the people then proceeds in lockstep with the globalist agenda
neoliberalist hell
a great true speech
thank you sir for a superb verbal truth world wide 1830
insane how backwards based on flawed logicbent data and pseudoscience this is jesus
brilliant thanks can we book him at the white house
free market capitalizm as an economic system is the only tool we have to end hunger poverty and destitution throughout the planet
god bless you
is this that guy with the chainsaw
just because something is cheaper doesnt mean it is good for the population anywhere  if they can make goods that dont harm you this is key
hes warning us of justin trudeaus play book
need to get this man and trump together they understand what the west is facing
wow awesome  speech thanks for commen sense im moving to argentina

god bless you sir
long live freedom  damn it  ill bet anything that the 007 james bond villain  also known as klaus schwab saw his blood boil upon hearing these words that are so true and powerful we must all decide which side were on  if you are for freedom for all then we must declare it so and make our decisions and live our lives in support of freedom for ourselves and every human being on the planet  the villainous people on the opposing side have been working for years to hasten our demise by stripping us of our freedoms theyve had a head start so we must get to work preserving our freedoms now and if god be for us theres simply no way we can fail  its so refreshing to listen to this speech and i for one am encouraged but we need hundreds if not thousands more leaders who will echo these same sentiments because you can be rest assured the people who oppose freedom for each of us will resort to the same tactics they always have which is to assassinate those who have a voice they use to speak out in opposition to the blatant tyranny they wish to impose upon us all we must do everything in our power to protect this man from the evil forces in the world who no doubt will seek to do him harm god please protect this man and help us all in securing freedom for the world  god bless the people in this comment section and god bless argentina and their newly elected leader
go argentina much respect to you sir
facts  argentina went through this all  horrible state  we need to all stop collectivism
i wish well to this guy at davosyeshe is telling the crowd the elite things that they need to hear but the  elite might be saying  are you telling us something we dont knowthis speech borderlines populism and demagogueryhe needs to implement corrective measures against corruptionwhich is an  economical cancer destroying most of our nationsexample is us capitalism already reached its maximum potential creating wealthbut wealth has a side effectgreedambition is still a good quality to have if your intentions are to improve human conditions in general along with your personal onebut when the motivation centers on improving only your personal condition ignoring the well being of others it becomes greedinessthis happens to most politicianssome scientists can achieve extreme wealth by inventing means to multiply productivity but use that wealth to manipulate the polititians along with the free marketthis is greed transforming itself into corruptionthats the problem with the wef socialist religious agendas and capitalism in generalwealth money corrupt us if  we dont create control mechanismsthe ultra rich wants more the reward center in our brains tell us money is good we want more and some ethnic groups  wants the pleasures of money without earning itturn into invading rich countriesstealingdemanding services they have no rights forchinasomehow has been able to implement mechanism of control against corruption  for me china is the less corrupted country in the worldso farunfortunately the us is the worsemilei has to be careful in choosing trading partners
i used to think it was the industrial revolution that led to the western worlds prosperity i now understand that it was freedom and capitalism that led to the creation of the industrial revolution it allowed both the pursuit of the inventions that created the industrial revolution as well as the freedom to scale and monetize those systems
and the crowd goes wild pin drop 
shame to hear some poor audio clipping otherwise a truly amazing talk
this makes me sick rich ppl telling the poor be happy it could be worse wtf
wow someone did their homework 
this dude talks about socialism but then puts goldman sacks in charge of argentinas economy and uses the usdhe looks every bit a cia asset installed into power to fool the people
they will be plotting his death as we speak
this is fake look at the lips
you go president miele we are right behind you america admires you keep safe
bullsit he have no idea what is he reading
why does it look like the glasses are a filter they look like they are floating 
what a joke so a society run by elites who own all the businesses is a great idea this guy needs to have a think
free market capitalism can end poverty  look i dont see how any system man has come up with could do thatmainly because any system always requires some number of people to make decisions and move money around and power corruptsbut of the system tried capitalism is definitely not one to end povertyit creates it  money flows from the many who have little to the few who have much  companies have the power to manipulate local and even the federal government getting tax breaks and kick backs and even bailouts   companies grow larger snuff out smaller operations and bully small suppliers they always look to maximize profits sending jobs over seas  even on a local level those with more than they need buy up properties to rent out building their wealth while making the housing market a harder place for new buyers to find a home  everywhere you look the desirenot to have what you need but to be wealthymeans that those who achieve success receive 10 20 or 100s of times the income for the same amount of time worked   meanwhile professions crucial for a society teaching police doctors firefighters and more are often under paid or there simply arent enough   capitalism as an answer to poverty has to be one of the dumbest things ive ever heard
fantastic
i love his final words long life and freedom dammit
amen
lets just hope that this brave man has extraordinary wellorganised security even for a head of state
i disagree  history shows differently   you leave out the economic hit men operation condor and pinochete
wait a minute they said this guy was crazy
why does this guy sound like a robot
im sure youtube is furious that they cant censor this man
take that commies
i would vote for milei   i really like his speech  so true  i want to see how many changes milei can make   i liked his video where he showed how he would eliminate different bureaucracies in the argentine government  right now moving to uruguay looks better but we will seecapitalism is freedom   you are free to vote with your wallet
interesting editing
where you gonna go when you die heaven or hell do  you choose satan or jesus christ trust and believe in jesus christ  and you will have eternal life reject him and the consequences are very bad choose wisely isnt ay joke you find that out very soon
so much unnecessary fear mongering
what a great speech
thanks
god bless and protect him
fantastic speech but im going to guess that the overwhelming majority of people at the wef are either directly state agents or entrepreneurs who dont as a primary economic model provide a service in a free market but instead collect huge government contracts   you cant have it both ways  you can say youre libertarian but if you build the very tools of coeresion and oppression that states use to take taxes from one group and steal resources from another youre actually just a self serving unprincipled scumbag   im looking at you peter theal elon musk  bill gates  all government contractors first and foremost and all for the defense sector
all theory until he can achieve growth stability and progress for his natiom then he is qualified to be listened  otherwise the beacon is there  follow the best examples around
if javier milei dies in the next two years he didnt commit suicide
wow i am so impressed by this man bravo to you sir
adam smith cheering from the grave
too bad the greedy ruling the new ussa dont care
his glasses refused to stay put through his whole speech and it has me rolling
im surprised they have the comments on thank you sir for standing up and having the balls to do this hopefully it gets to the right brains i doubt it thoughalso is your border open for  conservative us citizens i think were out of safe countries to run to when they achieve their agenda
as a canadian horrified that we havent banned trudeau from our beautiful country  this speech make me want to move to argentina  gives me hope
fearlesslight it up and keep preaching
wow wow frau klaus schwab listen and learn
viva la libertad carajo

wow mr president i am so proooud of you how lucky and wise is argentina for electing you i pray that more presidents are similar to you que dios te bendiga snor presidente javier milei
its pretty wild that the ai can translate the speech in his voice and change his mouth movement to match it it was a bit janky but im sure it will only improve in the next few years
argentina is so lucky to have such an excellent man at the helm
this was fantastic way to go javier
nothing but grandstanding
hows the world more peaceful now  where do you live  the world never have been in a such mess as now
i wont take the mark of the beast i wont worship the beast i wont bow to baal i wont eat bugs and i wont deny jesus christ
too edited
per capita gdp how about per capita income
president melei may turn out to be the best statesman for freedom of all time
javier milei is a  true leader come and be prime minister of canada please
and god bless you sir for putting the truth out for the people
why do i get the feeling that hes suddenly going to have incriminating evidence against the clintons and subsequently will be suicided
i think this is the only speech i have heard that s put speaks the truth  man has come to believe that  he knows it all  is arrogant greedy  power grabbing loves himself more than jesus  and thinks that every one else is less than an animal  how did america get to this point  i know but cannot say  th a nk god for one individual who  has some  common sense  may god bless us and keep us from this tyrrany and loss of any sense whatsoever  there is a god anx he is watching us to see if we will do his will and follow him  strengthen us and keep us ssfe  snk you for this mans truth
this mans speech need be played at all high school and universities every day after the national anthem
i believe this guy and trump could get the world on the right track without the wef and who
capitalism is the system of masspopulstions overcontrol aided by the science of economics  the money funded science of designing a onlyway ffered wayoflife of purchasable things  addictions forever sellable to its masses of little money funding generatorsplease release us from your debt slavery system of creating wealthy for your wealthy overlordsgive us 12 the earth back so we can returns the earth back to sustainabilityby letting us  naturally    95 compostablely nurture nature for our simplistic  humble sustainable provisionbefore its too late
it is not about free trade it is about governmentcontrolled trade   ive heard in state university in 2013 in germany my jaw dropped    lecture international economic relations
world evil forum
the greatest enemy of the west is as in the last century billionaresthey get so wealthy that literally they are above the law
god guarantees success so counties need to turn to the lord
thank you sir
listen mortals the sound of broken chains see the throne of noble equality freedomfredomfredom
in argentina we are led by a psychotic who does not want to understand that 100 years ago it was demonstrated that the market without state regulation is completely destructive unequal and that big business is not compatible with the common good god protect us
amazing hes right hes telling the truth but hes speaking to the common person hes not trying to obscure the message because the truth is often simple beautiful
wow what a breath of fresh air this man is applause
the reality is the people up top can care less about our freedom
yeah youtube aint much better in labelling opinions as hate speech besides definition of the word hate means a strong dislike we and indeed i have the right in expressing this stop dictating that was my mothers job
this was the most beautiful in your their face moment ever
what a load of bs how about the manipulation of gold price      the only thing holding the dollar up is a war
if i understand things correctly this guy likes free markets and capitalism  he hates socialism communism and libertarians  he thinks regulations always limit progress and growth he thinks protecting the environment is pointless and that business and industry are the only things that lift the people out of povertythe juxtaposition of ai making this video available to me in english with the idea that machines will take away my job and leave me starving to death because i have no use to the world is glorious i am a public school teacher socialism in the usa
this political leader speaks truthhow refreshing
missed one very important fact humanity is a spectrum not one color this means that we will never have one common governing system therefore we must learn to accept our differences and celebrate those differences not try to impose one system upon another each society needs to evolve or devolve at its own pace without interference but interference is all that the west believes
atleast the leaches said it although this guy is trying to get his last gap above water noone in the citizen sector will wake unless already woken sad sad days indeed
fake media ffs citizens this is not filmed at the wef 
since the fall of the soviet union something called globalization spread all over the world it is the interconnecting of most economies of the world in fact to make it short one tries to produce goods at places where it is the cheapest hence the whole world serves as a common market where everyone is in competition against each other to provide the cheapest prices for goods so that other international customers will choose to buy in your countrybut the fact is that the west pushed hard to establish for fullblown globalization because it would serve the west the most and the west almost achieved it had there not be the fact that china and russia rebelled after 2014 and decided to not follow the rulesbased international order any longer we would most likely sit in a fully globalized world nowadays but china decided to establish its own vision of an nwo and globalization and russia as well that led to major disruptions after 2018 in the global supply chains and after the corona years to the death of the globalizationnow take this into consideration if the west had succeeded with its plan to divide russia and gain access to all of russias resources china would have folded instantly there have been four attempts to achieve this1 napoleon2 hitler3 yeltsin who enabled the western effort to dismember russia in the 1990s the west tried that by inserting training and supplying islamic terrorists in russias caucasus regions this ongoing process was stopped and reverted when vladimir putin became president4 ongoing efforts to turn around russian allies located near russia and to bring them into nato this involved terrorizing russian populations in these former soviet countries to a induce russia to attack them and b to bring protest and conflict into russia because of perceived weak russian leadership this would trigger large scale protests which would have been taken over as soon as success was in sight by preplaced westerntrained puppet protest leaders and then doing again the same as was done with yeltsin fighting bloody civil wars all across russia and thereby making russia fall apartthat has been essentially the western goal for at least 250 years in fact far longer but my explanations started 250 years ago if russia and china folded or fell apart the west would become the sole ruler over the whole world since it would control almost all of the resources and markets and also be the unchallenged military power this would usher in the new world order or the rulesbased international order now you might assume that the united states would lead this new world order thats entirely wrong never forget especially if you are an american your only role in this scheme is to provide the military force to achieve the creation of the nwo and afterwards to act as some kind of police force when individual countries libya yugoslavia syria etc decide to not follow the rulesbased international order rbiothe dynasties that control the finance system and the mic which are both hierarchically above the national governments would use preestablished organizations to make themselves the undisputed rulers of some kind of world government which would have been the un if russia and china would have fallen
i was gonna say bro this is fake haha thanks for including the original
hes talking about obama and biden
collectolism hmmm ya people working together right not gonna happen even in the depths of hell people will screw everyone around them for momentary relief even if it means long term pain or worse services and commodities without god ai will need to come to control people
finally   someone speaks up against this evil cabal of globalists on their own stage    weve seen enough socialism and communism  sadly  across europe  no more 
the humane vs is winning 
thank you very much president amazing speech hopefully the world will wake up
standing with this common sense man 
im most definitely shadowbanned and this comment may not appear for any of you but on the off chance that you see this remember one thingthe damage from socialism remains for generations upon generations after its abolishment your country will not recover in 1 or two years time because now youre poor your land  stollen your business  taken away your spirit  broken most politicians that were part of the one and only party ruling over its nation will remain in politics forming different parties some of them leftleaning other  rightleaning but it doesnt matter because now corruption is rampant and theyll take advantage of that police will become blind to gangs and mafia will take over infrastructure will crumble because the money for building roads and edifices will go in someones pockets the judicial system will become as bribable as a cop on the street and justice will be served for those who lack funds not for those who deserve it i could go on and on but i dont plan on writing a book look at the former eastern block and the issues its facing 35 years after the dissolution of the ussr and youll understand what im talking abouti was born in the aftermath of socialism and im saying this with full confidence and ready to back it up with life experiencethe consequences of socialism remain for years and its not a pleasant experience in the slightest  the solution is  dont let it happen simple in words hard to accomplish unfortunately
oh thank god someone is bringing learning sound logic  and good sense back to the table i pray to live with liberty
using the argument that citizens in free countries live 25 longer then people from the other option maybe counter productive since  most of the davos who wef crowd want us all in poverty and dont want us to have long healthy lives they just want us around long enough to be of service to them the elites 
capitalism isnt the problem its the greed unethical business practices fraud cheating and associated political corruption related to capitalism that people have a problem with
ai
holy crap take it from him the county he reps   hit that freakin nail right on the head it is crystal clear the hidden powers are strongly manipulating the geopilitical scape and have are doing so with a strong emphasis on appeal to the leftist ideology we have but to observe and or study the social welfare of nations which observed socialism and communism it is madness in how so many are being swayedto go along with socialism either  madnessor plain ol lazy and self entitled people it is extremely obvious in that the leftists have been destroying our current monetary system covid markets manipulations creation of illegal immigrationwith added incentive of free moneyfoodroom n board and cell phones all while laying off american workers ie county workersfed workerssocial services due to immigrant welfare afreakingmazing i guarentee this incredibly accurate speech has gone in n out of the ears of 95 of the reps at this forum its up to the people to stand up in protest while still can before its too late im saving this speech
a man speaking truth 
is google buying and shutting down competing products good for consumers or growth no regulation is required a balance of power between private and government is required
look at all those cowards in there
this guy is full of it whos backing him big oil black rock all of the above
what an excellent speech he is not a yes manand he is not having it
wef is a socialist possibly nazi organization that has a satanic agenda against the world
the man is a legend 
very well illustrated the issue here is the new generation are highly influenced have no contrast to compare as anyone over 35 has dwindling belief in god the best construct of behavior goals for good parental failures among many other reasons all those who are over 35 must scream loud and bring old trends back loud and clear to provide the comparison needed god bless the west and get the coercion of socialism out of govt
non regulated capitalism generates monopolies and oligopolies in the us i have only one isp provider to chose from and i pay more than 80 dollars for internet friends in europe pay 25 dollars for fast intenet that includes a phone line because they can chose between a lot of providers how does a monoply benefit consumers
wake up america 
so much bs
bravo
the problem with capitalism is that its a very selfserving system that creates a moral dillemma for government officials and corporations who are more concerned with profit than the well being of the public examples like lobbying for certain regulations or companies making products that are designed to fail so you have to repurchase them companies paying for information to spread or covered that prevent regulation in there industry because that would hurt profits regardless if those regulations would be better for the consumers there are some major problems with capitalism and im eager to find solutions imagine we will have less problems as we advance we might be able to hold governments accountable and our ability to access more information on products and services should make it harder to be nefarious or self serving
the world is run by money and power and those who hold it will tighten their grip as much as they can
the socialism he is talking about is the kind where all the negatives of socialism is added to the people and all the good parts of capitalism is added to the wealthy nonpeople that way the herd is more manageable then it is in a free world
we are in post capitalism  corporate fascism the state is controlled by big pharmaceutical big tech and weapons manufacturers
i think the problem peoplebhave with capitalism is being confused with a problem of how our government is being lobbied and corporations are basically paying for influence also there is no way to hold the government accountable for how they spend our tax dollars or how they alter the monetary supply those are the main problems with capitalism it promotes profiteering and instead of corporations maming products with consumers best interest they are making them as cheap as possible or not effective like the pharmaceutical industry for example the quality of our food is diminishing as companies want to make things last longer and spray extra chemicals on everything despite health concers its all about maming money it really does creat a moral dilemma on the flip side hopefully we can work these problems out of capitalism with our upcoming technologies that will keep people more informed quicker and can hold governments accountable for budgets international funding etc
love it please keep sending that message in canada we need it desperately kind regards
its fake obvious as fuck but if it were real i still agreefuck the wef
take that klaus schwab
american citizens hear and heed because we are spiraling downward
that was actually an awesome speech i still imagine a time in the future where weve advanced past the problems with capitalism but for now it does seem to be the best eco system and maybe technology will allow us to better regulate the problems with capitalism and fine tune it in the future
wow long live javier milei god bless you
that ending was epic thank you very much and long live freedom damnit
the comment rules ask me to be civil and respectfulok but the video title is not respectful of anyones intelligence clearly even within the rhetorical usage of broke the internet this is just not true a ridiculous exaggerationcoming onto the area of politics how do we modify corporate behaviour to ensure it isnt profitable to dump pollution in rivers we regulate there is such a thing as externalities in economicswhat is the right balance that debate will run forever maybe he is inspired by argentinas recent political past and perhaps it would benefit from a fresh approach i dont know enough to be sure time will tellto argue that government should just be squished no i dont agree government has emerged in response to deficiencies in life without it
thanks
his example of the market failure being due to government intrusion is playing out right now in ford and gm they have both produced electric vehicles that nobody is buyingwants they will take a huge loss on this because governments like california are setting mandates to go carbon neutral by 2030 that are completely unrealistic people do not want this and cannot afford to purchase a new 90000 ev car to replace a currently perfectly performing gasoline car
president milei the free world stands with you    
no ai  required   just good old  uncommon   commonsence  hank  god  last 
this guy is a true american
who wrote it for him
awesome speech so glad he was elected for argentina
nap is 
god bless you and give you strenght and protect you
holy fuck he said it
our goal should be to eradicate poverty everywhere except where the individual chooses that life
monopoly corporatism is not free market capitalism it is just another form of collectivism to control the masses and is the antithesis of the capitalist system follow it at your peril
bravo  bravo     bravisimo
im reminded of something that tocqueville once saiddemocracy and socialism have nothing in common but one word equality but notice the difference while democracy seeks equality in liberty socialism seeks equality in restraint and servitudeyes very appropriate
bravo bravothe whole world needs to hear this and embrace the values of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness thru self determination and not government and corporate rule
world leaders have been subjugated i do not disagree with his premises
is this real he keeps on glitching it looks like an ai generated splice edit
if the whole world can see what trudeau and freeland are doing to canadians then why cant canadians see it
great insight i done think that one was submitted for approval beforehand
el mejor presidente de la historia de la humanidad lo tiene argentinasaludos desde argentina
what he is saying makes sense to me the problem is it doesnt make sense to the people who want to rule the world and everything and everyone in it
ouch deep fake really sux
i am studying for a bachelor degree and this year one of the compulsory subjects for this degree is social justice the ideas of social justice collective thinking are pushed through the educational system universities
i think i now know where i might be able to retire to now 
amen god bless and keep you
bravo 
controlled opposition
you wont own nothing and you will be happy something in me says that melei doesnt agree with that concept
what is the psyop behind it do you really thing this happened in wef by chance didnt you learn something in this last 4 years
damnthey really got us on the pursuit of happiness thing keep running never getting there pursuit of property sounds so much safer now wow
i dont think hell be allowed back next year but what a speech loved the ending especially long live freedom damn it 
plz help us in new zealand too x
davos can eat a bag of richards 
this dog failed already
the most  interesting  spech i ever heard this is a real leader for the argentina people you people are in good hands  now
this speech represents antifamily values it is families that embody collectivism and socialism and if family values were more capitalistic the family would be considered abusive and it is clear that community including a nation are the larger forms of family and therefore embody family values
brave man trump gave the same sort of speech to the wef during his term and made an enemy of everyone there
it is all obv that all of this with the globalists is a setup theyve been undoing ppl that go against them suddenly this clown shows up and is being a smart   yeah umm obv fabrication
great speech
what is it someone stole your sweetroll
very good speech  i am with you  from california thanks
demons talking
he hit the nail on the head at the 945 mark where hes talking about the loss of life by 100k because that is the wefs goal is to depopulate by 90k within the next year these are the numbers they already put out last year data dont lie
milei showed the delusion of the wef and its antichristian policy were in the endtimes google lostbiblicalinsights to find out god bless
the failed policies of the democratic party will be the doom of our country unless trump turns it all around after reelections
f the wef
well in 1800 etc rothchild owned england and after ww1  americas banks sooo all this poverty talk is bullshit      poverty is manmade
much respect from 
yeah baby this guy is awesome plus he really reminds me of  austin powers from argentina  argentina powers love his balls  nothing is more sexy then a man not afraid to stand up for whats right no matter to who and no matter the cost  a true example of a hero to the world in this instance and ive not seen any for a very very long time and its about time too     long live freedom dammit
es exactamente lo contrario la pobreza mundial va en aumento mientras unos pocos sentados a la mesa se reparten los recursos naturales despojando de su tierra a los campesinos ind√≠genas negritudes y minor√≠as de sus tierras y las venden a los empresarios nacionales y extranjeros hablo por colombia es peligroso generalizar
hearhear bravo brilliant speech we need more like him
this guys going to send argentina to hell
you just gained my respect 
today states dont need to control the means of production to control every aspect of individuals lives
this guy is as brainwashed as they get i wonder who wrote this speech for himthe market that he promotes is open to manipulation which is something that people rarely addressin any political system the thing that fails us is corruption be it socialism or capitalismwe will own nothing and we will be unhappy renters
when he says socialism does he actually mean communism
citizens of free countries live 25 longer then repressed countries
this man is a true leader of the world
long live freedom damnit
this guy made my neck hurt from all the agreeing i wish we had such a leader in germany he is putting you and the best way available and will be a plasure  to see argentina economy  growing again to his old glory
he is right
all that education we have for free gave us the skills that gave us all the riches we have not the capitalism 
unlimited and unregulated trade has ignored climate change and their effects on health for way too long how can someone argue that we should not have a state to protect us from these adverse effects newly emerging viruses vector borne diseases obesity due to heavily marketed and promoted processed sugary sodium rich saturated fats etc foods and increase in natural disasters are empirical facts too entrepreneurs have failed to address these challenges so far most political attempts have been suboptimal but they are at least trying to not shove children into dark pits to scrape some rare earths out of dark mines
not the best info or he ignores deliberately 200 that the jump in gdp around the world came with the industrialization not the capitalism
it was the steam machine and the tractor changing the horse that did it sir not your magic system 
and what about of covering and protecting  of  nazists after  ii war   your  country did 
austin powers
god love the bosses who pay minimum wage with no healthcare god bless the people who have 70 million plus slaves in 2024 on the planet  they are helping the freemarket  god bless those ceos who have increased their bonuses and wages multiple multiples times from previous decades i hear they have increased their iqs beyond genius thus their improved salaries  they are the most worthy  god bless the 1 and the billionaires who throw crumbs at us and invest and reduce rights and lobby to improve their rights  koch brothers god bless employers who like amazon time your toilet break god bless the government monopolies for certain sector for the private sector to make profit godless globalisation where it goes to the cheapest labour force in the world oh those factories closing down and sacking people and move it to tears of joy in the the free marketgod bless politicians for thousands of years your worth to humanity is valueless as i cant think of anything you have done that has been good value but cost money from your patrons and tax payers  if your reduced politicians by 95 around the world you save money and have less corruption around the globe too many politicians and tiers from town to country to federation get rid ofgod bless china your manufacturing and dumping goods in other countries is proof that freemarket works thank you god bless the banks and mortgage lenders they they didnt fail or go to the wall they didnt get a socialist handout from the western government  it was a dream a lie as in a proper free market they go to wall  no intervention those who broke the rules go to jail never happenedgodless the economists for not taking into consideration technology and improvements to reduce poverty it was all due to the profits of disney and their brilliant economic theory oh adam smithso when had western europe usa canada  or argentina in the last 200 years been communist or socialistgod bless those who listen to economics their predictions and accuracy is so nearly 100 sorry more like never get it correctgod bless the trade embargos setup by one freemarket country on another so freemarketgod bless the distraction they are all communists  it socialism that is at fault bring back the debtors courthell get rid of all taxes and let be a dogeatdog lets all spiral down my rock vs your rock
milei is spot on the west should pay attention and learn from him
dude applying for chat gpt6 voice this guy should never public speak i am robot hear me speak
ok so now i can see why he was presented by the msm and other institutions as a whack job theyre seriously frightened by this man who so eloquently and courageously speaks the truth  he is absolutely right on all counts
guys gonna slip on a banana peel and fall out a window
i vote for him to be the president of the united states i bet the wef in pooping all over themselves right now
it was the tractor replacing the horse that did it sir not your system
at 017 is this translation of the speech completely correct
well yea the only thing that this guys missing is that the capitalism is in fact the goverment of choice of 80 of the world for the last 50 years or so all the wars economic dowfall and poverty as been created to keep the system runing who says capitalims is bad no one and socialism is bad no the countries using a dif political system are also providing a good goverment for their citizen so stop the bullshit be whatever you want and stop killing babys is that to much to ask 2024 guys remember  we are not in the caveman world to belive in ideologic ptys nor religion as arguments
it was the tractor replacing the horse that did it sir not your system 
this speech has been edited to not include certain areas of the real speech
deep fake
wtf fail

how dare they they have systematically impoverished millions and millions of middle class folks are now poor and the poor are now homeless soon there will be no cars either or ownership of anything if this keeps going in the same direction i can hardly wait for the new x to reduce us to scarce as polar bears this is so sad to watch well im not eating bugs or drinking the koolaid  freedom and peace in brotherhood  soon we wont be able to buy or sell without the mark  but thats a conspiracy soon we will be jailed in our own homes in 15 minute cities controlled and videoed for all times watched monitored  judged and controlled and hopefully not found lacking for who knows what comes next imagine that 
looking forward to the reawakening of argentina props from portugal
i thought this guy was a nutter with his chain saw actbut after 15min50s he really summaririses the west the eu he stuck two fingers up to the eu much respect to mr milei
down in the history books
long live justice and prosperity
doesnt he understand they dont want to save ppl they want to depopulate us
people need to take care and control their own lives and not give that control and care to the state dont be a sheep that is feeded by the state because the state wont care for you as well that you can do thinking by yourself and being  free make a country prosperous
we need people like him in europe
it may be important to note that the reason why everything he is telling sounds so brilliantly simple is because he is plainly wrong i wish argentina good luck with this man
the problem that those who are wealthy do not recognize their own wealth i give the usa as an example with an air conditioner and every single building you walk into there is no other country where this is true and yet you have citizens of the us complaining about poverty when they do not live in poverty not even close to povertybut because they do not have as much as their neighbor they believe themselves to be among the poor when they are among some of the wealthiest people on the planettheir failure to recognize this is why communism and socialism keep  rearing their ugly headsthey scream for socialized medicine forgetting that anyone with money anywhere in the world under such a system is going to come to the us for their medical care because you get what you pay for and we have the most expensive medical system in the world because we have the best medical system in the world
he is absolutely right 100
rigs guy just shot himself in the leg sorry to say this
good luck argentina nice people bad rulers
individual property ahahah
good for you javier for speaking out the truth to the members in the economic forum
thanks 
fake glasses wierd morfing of mouth wierd lines around him is the annual meeting 2024 sign even realwhat he is saying sounds good but is it really from wefcgihologramwhats going on with this 
trudeau is the poster child for what is destroying the west
this is the most important video i have ever seen
i was wrong about this guy i thought that he was another wef puppet i was wrong
free market capitalism is the only way
i love this guy
but why are they letting him speak at wef the wef know that many people are waking up to who they are and their plansagendas is this damage control is this to spin us into thinking their not so bad swaub is a bad poster image they know they need a new image is this it
epic well said
thank  you mr pr√§sident fromargentinen
still undermining the fact that even that the world is getting richer we are literally growing dept the game is rigged as long as we play by the monetary system rules
rhetoric word salad giving credit to fmc instead of technologyengineering
sounds great but but but can the planet adapt to no limits of growth mining the depths of the oceans destroying the last of our forests our oceans and nature habitats
free market capitalism abolish crony capitalism at all cost
el javo con ia en ingles es espectacular
absolutely first rate
we are heading for ww3 all signs point to this countless nations are spending huge on military upgrades currently many use the cover of replenishment  from helping   fact is we are in a global arms race and the last time world economies were in such bad shape was the great depression sadly a war footing will stabilize many western economies so yes my estimate is we are within 2 years of the beginning  thats a generous estimate
tldr man argues against governments in favour of private monopolies
i was loved by everyone in houston until i came out against tyrannical wokeleftist agenda and now im cancelled and not making enough sales to continue making art for a living anymore whats really sad is most conservatives buy shitty abstracts from commies who want them dead i actually support the hard work of the wealthy and im a hard worker with more skill than any of these commies combined the left keeps winning the hearts and minds of people through the artsenterainment just visit a gallery or museum and see the garbage they are vomiting onto the public if you want to help take back our culture please follow and support artists who have the balls to stand up against an industry that literally tries to kill us artists who speak out against their failed ideologies
simply amazing   thank you
beautiful
father i ask you to set your angels of protection around argentinian president javier milei  and his family and those with him in his nation bless those who put their life on the line to help free the masses
lets see where argentina ends up in the next 4 years
damn what an excellent speech the section on neoclassicals was particularly hardhitting and important since such models have become the modern paradigm
have whatever opinion you want i will never work for a horrible person like this your understanding of the world makes people miserable i want no part of it
the american government needs to let people be free if someone wants to smoke they shouldnt have to pay a tax to do it if someone wants to pitch 50 tents on their property the government needs to buy out if someone wants to give their belongings or money away the government needs to buy out if i had a billion dollars i would want to buy a home for every american but the government wouldnt allow it without getting their cut this is the problem with those who say we are free you can go to work and be a slave so the government can take the majority of your earnings but if you are one of the top 3 and have billions our government condemns charity by severely punishing the wealthy for being humane everything is about control and power and greed these people dont even comprehend what it means to be humane and have no comprehension of what christianity is yet constantly preach how christian they are while people are freezing to death and dying from heat stroke because they are homeless and being exposed to the elements capitalism would work a lot better if people werent so greedy and power hungry
bravo  well done president milei this gives me hope
free speech is important this man is correct if the playing field was equal lets talk education rates unemployment people dying from curable disease and child wellfare those are the standards of a successful civilians all capitalists need to be regulated lets talk banks in the us till the 1980s we used to make 15 on our balances now  with all this great capitalism its less the 2   robbery should not be part of capitalism but it is everyone is crook trillions  stolen from every war the us has been involved in free palestine
his english language is fantastic  his ideas have merit but are too simplistic  not all people are able to be capitalists  freedom to be able to make money without being punished doing it is very important  help for individuals who can do this is just as important
manipulation 10190 of the people looking at this understand nothing about macroeconomics and will just take everything for factsgod help us
interesting speech the leftists marked this elected president as an airhead his speech shows a different quality common sense
he was put by god to go after the crooked politicians and corporations keep praying for peace around the world 
wow finally a common sense speech well said i wish there were move brave leaders like him
what is scary is that this even had to be said omg but unfortunately the world is being broken by design  hence biden is president in the us what could be more obvious that a purposeful destruction is underway than biden in office
very powerful
please take a look at economical strategy of holy companion the 3rd choosen caliph usmanuthman ghani ra of the rashidoon empire who turn city of theif into city of scholars baghdad within 11 years filter it with modernised economical structure what you will get filter it again with your countrys economical structure use the remaining when you think it is time
glad we all agree that capitalism is far more acceptable than global corporatism or globalism
im such a fan of this manalso u know whats weird im from the netherlands which is always assumed to be socialist even i thought so but we literally invemted stocks and hace a free market economic model so even socialism needs capitalistic elements to survive
he spoke the truth now who is the enemy of democracy
load of waffle historical economics in todays world doesnt apply
im glad i can hear his message  in english
he doesnt speak english be careful
you guys voted a bad ass president in good for you
im from a socialistwesteren country with free kapitalism we have a kings and queens but they have no power at all and not one word to say in democratic or goverment direction at allwe have some of the highest taxes so that everyone gets free healthcare are payed to take an education and you can start your own buisness in a single day and our goverment will support and help you the few people living in poverty are helped and healthcare is free and superbwhat i can take from here is that these westeren countries should have payed more to poor countries and well we did and we do but the countries have failed in using these money and the help to make them self sufficient and at the same time refused help and then ran off with the cash the only enemy here is communism as we see with countries like china and russia he sounds more like the poor guy who wants hand outs rather than live up to the reality that you have to make an effort to make the change for yourself and for your countryi mean it was his own country who fell for power and curruption problems and is now trying to blame the countries that made it but when you have to combat dictatorships and countries run by the mafia or religious people whos wet dream is to turn the clock back to the stoneage you cant just give them the tools to make that happen
may our lord jesus bless and protect this man for he has a voice and vision for truth in a world so full of deceptionthank you sir brian  stexas
you know hes right
this is the next pinochet ultra liberalism and authoritarianism combined and completely unmasked this guy does not care about anyone but his own interest
this video appears to be animated and not legit footage his face is animated the audio is stated as being ai translated  it could also be reading a script that is not quotes from wef
this man is a gem  argentina may have a chance
using ai to translate this speech was a grand idea
everyone should watch this  in every country  thats why also the wef is drowning countries in promoting illegal invasion so as to prevent the nations fighting back
true 
the year 1932 finds a world sore perplexed with its economic worries powerful nations with a long history of industrial of industrial and social progress feel their foundations unstable men fear a crash that might wipe out in months the progress of centuries knowledge skill  scientific devices productive capacity are at higher point than ever before but some basic defects in the method of utilising these factors at this juncture in history prevent them from rendering their fruits to mankind and create a position full of menace millions of competent workers stand idle in the streets of new york berlin london sydney and the plants and machinery and material for the handling of which posses the necessary skills lie unused and deteriorating from early times man has dreamt of an age of plenty prophets have foretold the coming of  a utopia where work would be light and the material needs of life would be satisfy with ease and abundance for all when for the first time in history the conditions for the realization of this dream seams nearly in their grasp instead of confidence and hope fear fills the minds of men jame maxton british socialist mp
what a legend i hope the elite listen instead of finding ways to silence him respect and love thank you sir
the whole speech is fake
hope he stays safe
amazing
ai will soon have translators phased out
i really like the argentine president go president milei
well excellent speech someone actually saying what the selfimportant members of the wef want the people to be just like the middle ages when  95 of people were surfes to the aristocrats in other words more or less slaves
amazing speechpeople that push to socialism  always want control
thank you sir
watch it or mr dull gets it
i pray hes not indangerbut hes a wef member is he not 
wow
truly awesome  another davos heroi wish we the world could all stand next to them in total support
true on so many levels
why cant we get intelligent presidential candidates in the us like this guy
im cool woth no more monetary transactions but im not cool with certain people having everything they want and need while the others dont hhhhmmmmmdang it man even capitalism does that
this video is a heavily altered version of the speech
definitely this is a video to share
what a populist and nonsensical speech i suspect it was written by ai too
your truth is appreciated  thank you for your articulation 
for 70 years manufacturing is what gave the west momentum from 1946 to 2016 the last  decade we handed that responsibility  technology to china now they r getting rich while the west goes into decline
yas queen
3
socialism had been poverty vandalism exodus and privacy  of individual freedom
yes yes yes a million times yes i rlly have lost hope and accepted how more difficult my life was gonna get living hereseattle im so glad there is someone speaking on this tttt
true
keep this man safe from this evil corruption god bless him
he sounds like hes ready to win a war
he will say why would pay for a crackheads treatment but never mentions the single moms who are having a bad luck strike whose partner passed and never mentions their kids he wants to sell argentinian state initiatives for cheap thats all this circus about he will continue doing business with china hipocrisy is the name of the song
my internet still works anyone elses broke
my internet is working fine not broke at all
amen they just want to continue brainwashing the people same as hitler did and the only people that want this communismsocialism is the ones already in power and the ones brainwashed by the ones in power
i guess there will be an earthquake in argentina in the next days
1115 he who smelt it dealt it
comunism work made fidel the killer a billionere
lucky the disgruntled bird    has returned from the outerregions     exceptional speech the globalist wont let folks simply exist and receive universalincome      a mandatory bodychip and frequent brainworn injections    will be only the beginning intelligence independent thought and critical thinking    will be systemically biologically removed from the new human being the brain worms will be needed    until humans have been adequately deevolved 
excerpt from geneva vs peace the real forces at work written by  comte de saintaulaire ambassador of france to great britain from 192024 in 1937recollecting a conversation with a jewish banker who explained that gives you a partial explanation why bolshevism finds favor in our eyes  it is an admirable salting tub in which to corrode and destroy and not to preserve but beyond and above this particular instance we are in communion with marxism in its purest form in the international in other words with our religion because it is the weapon of our nationalism in turn defensive and offensive buckler and sword you will say that marxism is the very antithesis of capitalism which is equally sacred to us it is precisely for the reason that they are direct opposites to one another that they put into our hands the two poles of this planet and allow us to be its axis these two contraries like bolshevism and ourselves find their identity in the international
nothing to add flabbergastedthis is the whole truth and nothing but the truththis speech might be the spark that will save us from catastrophe
brilliant with such based leaders the future of freedom and prosperity will be latin american
pure capitalism is just an evil and dangerous as pure socialismstop pushing eitheror we need capitalism with a conscience socialism with freedom to the individual or it leads to todays wealth gap and failure of social power sharing capitalisms inherent greed is no better than government overreach 
i love this guy
this homie is capping hard
aldrig ni skulle f√• h√∂ra en svensk politiker s√§ga sanningen dom har s√•lt utv√•rt land god bless this man
the next elensky
is it me or does it look ai generated the mouth looks weird
good to see these tyrants are in no position to stop truth
javier is  right
everyone in the comments cheering about this guy calling fire departments and interstate highways market failures truly we are living through a depressing brain virus against collectivism
we need conscientious capitalism we need capitalism that is good for the planet and good for the people not just good for a few
why cut off some of the words
true words but they will not listen it wont even sink in what they want is to be the rulers of the world a one world government will never work but they dont really care
his english is great only heard him speak spanish protect this man
2024 the year of truth  expect more
most listeners are a bunch of delinquents there at summit these politicians are thieves by credo
arent globalist central bankers in his cabinet
excellent
whyy are there sudden cuts in hisvoice and the video every 5 seconds or so
holy sht bravo president javier milei  can we please share him argentina we can just fudge some birth documents and put him on the poles for president of the united states as well  or maybe he can at least be our vice president
people its time to wake up and take our country back mr milei is 100 accurate we have fallen asleep at the wheel believing our fake leaders and now its time we get the voices back there is no other candidate that can do this but trump the one who planted the seed and opened our eyes is the one who will finish cleaning the swamp wake up
what a hero where in the world are the rest of you
truth
the original of this mans speech was absolutely groundbreaking inspiring and made me feel some hope for the future this ai generated version scares the hell out of me and makes me need to ask why couldnt you people leave it alone the man had something to say and he didnt need help saying it especially by artificial intelligence
javier miles you are awesome so articulate and an excellent speech
let those who love freedom move to argentina he sounds like some of our former leader who wrote the us constitution which was based on biblical principles our  fathers fled persecution from europe from the union of  kings and papal powers that oppressed the people the dark ages to a better land to be govern by the people and for the people  that is why usa prospered and was blessed but now we are being deceived  by the prince of darkness and his evil agents  to control and take away our human rights  we are in the finals last and worst years of human history climate change is not because of co2 but signs of christs second coming to warn the people to prepare and not to be deceived  read matthew 24 and revelation  chapters 13 the first beast is describing the papacy and the second beast verse 11 is the usa  to enforce the mark of the beast they must have central bank digital currency cbdc so you can not buy or sell gods last message to world is found in revelation 14612 there are but two powers that control the minds of menthe power of god and the power of satan signs of times june 29 1891man is satans captive and is naturally inclined to follow his suggestions and do his bidding he has in himself no power to oppose effectual resistance to evil it is only as christ abides in him by living faith influencing his desires and strengthening him with strength from above that man may venture to face so terrible a foe every other means of defense is utterly vain it is only through christ that satans power is limited this is a momentous truth that all should understand satan is busy every moment going to and fro walking up and down in the earth seeking whom he may devour but the earnest prayer of faith will baffle his strongest efforts testimonies for the church vol 5 p 2942for more info see videos from amazing facts ministry god bless
how on earth did he get away with speaking these truths obviously not one of their minions
this man is awesome
lol javier mileimake argentina great again
mind explain why there are less black poeple in argentina first
i didnt see this reported on the biased broadcasting company  need one ask why
he forgot to mention that most of the people lifted out of poverty in the past 50 years lived in communist china soviet union and vietnam
i love this man may he be successful for the world and argentina 
talking good about chile  is all what    he is doing but chile have something worst than politicians corrupt the low moral asset by economical groups fixing prices and no paying obligations  best wishes with the cultural change  nobody say argentina  have no port to make numbers nobodys talking about 
brilliant speech by javier milei thank you javier for your ability to speak the truth so well you are a great president for argentina
how did he even get on the stage to give this speech  the villains must have been asleep for a moment or they let him speak so they could virtue signal and say how great  and fair they are  i hope and pray he has some top notch body guards and security
president javier milei   the donald trump of argentina    a damn good thing he is
viva la libertad carajo milei es un heroe 
incrediblespeaking truth

bless him
im sorry are we at war with ai i really cant tell whats real and whats not this is crazy
you vill own nothing and be happy  hope the message of this argentinian wonderman president has hit home to the wef elite who are trying to stifle nations and citizens and help them along with jabbathons where they cant be stifled
very good actors 
legend
wow they make this guy out to be a radical crazy man in the uk press when hes just providing some home truths for everyone
amen the truth hurts aye wef  
 ai
though i wonder where he considered th hobbs to the pure sense of matter
president javier milei thank you for saying that out loud
follow the money been saying this since i was a child turn of tribal reasoning no parties just look at the wealth of tge world and observe the patterns that are easy to find throughout history the patterns constantly repeat
been saying that for 20 years
seems like a repeat of ayn rand 
when economics make sense
to be clear businesses can fail due to bad decisions but those individual failures are a healthy result of the market the people deciding what they want and what they do not the market on the whole doesnt just take a nosedive entire industries do not fail without a clear cause currency debasement however can cause the entire market to take a hit regulations can cause an industry to suffer these are things we have to account for and not just take politicians word for it
canadian politicians watch and learn
to bad this is an ai speech
no he didnt hes just promoting cronie capitalism that extracts money from the working class and gives it to oligarchs like bill gatesargentina is a disaster and will be sold to blackrock thx to this guydont fall for this theres a reason he was allowed to speak there
incredible   this message is frightening but sound thank you so much for having the courage to speak up experience is priceless as they say  those who do not learn from  the past is doomed to make the same mistake in the future this is the futurerespect
ah yes we have only done capitalism for 200 years and it is now the best solution it hasnt even been long term trialed agianst technological evolution yet or cultural shift 200 years is nothing in civilisation scale timelines
absolutly fantastic milei 
wrong  hes wrongthis seems like a legit angle  it is the same angle that capitalists have been shouting for decades  but economic numbers are not the whole picture  we have to look at stress on our planet in the form of neverendinggrowth  this is nature  no single species can overly dominate a closed habitat the earth for much length of time  for example we keep overfishing  we have started fishing farms but the quality isnt the same  you cant expect salmon in a closed farm eating corn of all things will stay a healthy fish to eat  within a few short generations well have some weird nonnutritious white fish that has nearly zero benefits to eat  might as well skip the process and just eat corn  this is just one example of how untethered capitalism goes way off the rails  analysts who stay stuck in the financial only number never seem to consider the bigger picture  now im not saying that brutal authoritarian communism is the answer  its not  but we need a new system  we need a system that does not waste yet rewards innovation for sustainability  like with capitalism it causes companies to make things that break often  because then people need to buy more  this is why capitalism is not sustainable  because were just throwing stuff away for the purpose of making profits look good on paper for awhile longer  but the longer it goes on the more unrecoverable this crap will be  also none of these very few points get into major financial inequality  weve got a shitload of homelessness in the usa  im guessing its even worse in many other countries  that problem keeps getting worse with cutthroat capitalismcheck out my handlename question everything  its because platitudes in speeches can easily sway someone who doesnt quickly question the deeper and wider picture
socialism is like a cancer it destroys everything it touches 
the chatbots really love his speech i can tell by the comments but seriously hes just a more savage version of menem menem tried shock therapy tried privatization and the whole cut social spending and give all your money to the rich routine and argentina has been an economic basket case ever since the complete opposite of what he said if there is anything true to interpreted from this is that the ultra rich are intent on keeping late capitlism business as usual and have no problems putting this clown behind a lectern a give a speech that would have milton freidman blush they are doubling down at a moment when they should be pulling a 180 anyone who thinks this clown will get anything done is either a chump or knowingly on the wrong side of history
this is true  this is so true we live in a world where no body should be homeless and they shouldnt go to sleep hungry at all  but somehow we have been infiltrated by a evil entity  we people needs to ban together and fight this corruption thats happening in our world  wake up humans beings   you can stop this corrupted system if you open youre minds and help each other   people of this earth  you must stop all this corruption in your countries  you all have that power so go for it  only we humans beings have nothing to lose  wake up 
sadly most of the people who have power and listen to this might aswell listen to white noise since they block that out and do their idealistic policy
wacko so the phenomenal growth he applauds was generated by economies suffering under the sorts so regulations he wants to eliminate makes perfect sense 
i feel his conviction with what hes saying but what about the part about how the things being sold are contributing to the ruin of the earth economic prosperity is still connected to producing nonessential products that pollute our water and end up in landfills i what hes saying makes sense from working within the current world system and i dont agree with collectivism as we see it today but in america 14 years ago our government created citizens united it gives corporations the same rights as american citizens and its the root of the wealth inequity we see today deregulation is not the answer libertarianism works on an individual level but i dont believe it will work on a governmental level we must look beyond capitalism to solve the problems we face now capitalism is rooted in competition and production of goods both of which are killing the planet they say that most jobs in the future will be done by machines where does that leave us there is a huge global conflict looming between democratic nations and fascist communist together with muslim nations the stage is being set now by xi and putin in the next 5 years they will try to bring democracy down democratic nations need to come together to protect the freedom that we have the future will be won not by those who are morally superior but by those who are strongly united in purpose democratic free nations cannot become divided over things like palestine or ukraine we are coming into a time when we must come together with one voice and say no to facism regardless of what you think of the united states we must come together to stand for democracy democratic first world nations need to work collectively and strategically to create a plan to fairly invest in infrastructure and jobs in developing nations
the discovery and innovation he mentions necessitates oppression of populations and pillaging of lands
he was allowed to speak because he is pro capitalism  globalist  free market  this is aligned to the wef mantra he is one of them
you goddamn right
i hope for his sake and that of the rest of the world that he has some dam fine security
many elite politicians are failed lawyers or deluded academics who could not run a lemonade stand
true libetarian and communism is a utopia  i think that socialism has become an umbrella term  this is an interesting time we are in  i am curiosit√© about the new √©conomics th√©ories coming up
highly recommend people read up on ayn rand regarding for the new intellectual  she knew all about this back in the 30s and 60s
hey i know this comment might get lost but please do not take this videos success as incentive to clickbait again in the future the best part of this video is the production value ai has come a long way
he needs a new brain soon his country will be bankrupt
a real hero
as a hungarian living under a cleptocratic regime run by excommies spies and snakes i hope well soon have a leader like president milei
not only taking the moral high ground by taking a commercial flight to davos but then bringing receipts to justify his position rather than assuming a moral collectivist collectionist position
hes an argentinian ronald regan men like this are rare in government and should be listened to
if theres no government tax and oversight who will stop me from polluting the environment in pursuit of cheaper production or protect my assets from hostile takeover by criminal organizations or neighbouring states who want my means of production free of charge
the fractional reserve federal  central banking is the backdoor our enemies have attacked us from so who controls this scheme who hides behind money yet controls the world there is a big difference between the puritans and the pilgrims that came here
wow argentina needs this man wish we had him
controlled opposition
this makes no sense he says nice things and then aligns himself with israel
this is an excellent overview of what socialism does in the hands of the communists and the liberal dems
well put
well so far i like him

o yes we all remember the industrial age with its free capital markets with no support for the workers as such a great time corruption is corruption you should focus on cracking down on it instead of freaking out about you marketsyou all really think there will be no corruption nor monopolies in a capitalist society every society can become corrupt focus on that and establish laws that can help people rather than removing all laws and hoping the system will just magically fix it self
oh  come on  saying that there is no such thing as market failure is demonstrably wrong examples   left to the market many people would not be able to pay school fees apart from a few tollroads there is no system of roads in the world delivered by markets etcetc
correct in contents of what worked of past the problem not addressed into the puzzle picture we all are apart of is the fact of the technology now at mankinds usage when ai robot worker servants are incorporated into humans civilization construct if all controlled by ones never ending self greed above everyone elses actual survival needs corruption occurs of that no collective construct due now to the fact mankind is no longer needed to work as servant to others to provide for ones needs perhaps if the collective of the whole earth sphere could adjoin under ideology that lets creativity still expand without the need for each others destruction to get ones own selfish needs technology alone can never be the full pattern of construct there must be free agency of each ones own personal spiritual growth in a manner that does not subjugated control of physical or mental upon each otherif the true bases of creation was known and it is known then there is the foundation of ideology that supports and adjoins with other creational estates that are of higher understanding of universal brotherhood truth as known is the first key of all keys without there can be no universal advancement of lower evolutionary will driven creatures inhabited earth sphere into or of the universal brotherhood that exists as it stands now prepare for a mighty war of ideology of incorrectness
b r a v o best speech ever especially in the usually hypocrit and stinking with lies wef
limitless economic growth is not possible on our planet with finite resources economic growth as a standard is not a way to serve the needs of people and other life on earth  the reason that our western governments are doing so bad is that they are entangled with the big companies and superrich media the weapon industry banks big agro big tech the wef  and big pharma for example are deeply involved in democratic processes  with this great speech he blaims socialism but there is hardly any socialist government left in the western world in this way hes just supporting the wef this has absolutely nothing to do with democracy
liar  free market is a myth  and  modern capitalism devours democracy
here we go again  every time the is an economic downturn people step up and offer extreme solutionswhat milei is offering is little different from that offered by mrs thatcher and ronald reagan  a belief in the free marketyes milei is right that market economies are more productive etc than command economies but the figures he produces are not for freemarket system they are for socialmarket systemswhat works best is the system free market where possible rebularted where necessary and public sector through taxation for that which cannot be provided by the pmarlketlets have less simplistic thinking pleasesure argentina needs smaller government than at present but if he throws the baby out with the bathwater he will get a different helllook at britain today  most young people have little hope of owning their own home  this is the result of the freemarket policies of thatcher which freed the banking system to lend money more easily  this has gradually driven up house pricesno the free market is not a panaceano social justice is not one eitherwe need a pragmatic approach with demonstrable results
this dude did not hang himself
love the guy and he is right i live in dubai where the state is not present in the market as he says and the growth is there
if this was real they will never invite him back to their meeting guaranteed lol if it is fake then  oooo
wef is a criminal organisation what must happen to a criminal organisation according law
he can undoubtedly read
thank you siryou are a breath of fresh air and finally a true leader who tells it  in a way that everyone can understand
hes insisted everyone report their crypto  tricky  nope
capitalism with real rules regulations and a tax structure that actually supports democracy and communities like usa from 19451980 however crony unrestrained capitalism like usa from 18651945 and 1990present was a boom and bust economy that saw the top 110 getting ridiculously wealthy and the middle class strugglingand the rates of poverty that holds back the growth and development of usa and every country so capitalism that works for all he is partially wrong about wealthso much is inherited and hoarded incentives were not destroyed from 19501980 in usa when top marginal and progressivetax rates were 7090 and so many corporations and people became very wealthy and the middle class exploded does he mean that taxes should be voluntary if so he is living in the same dream world as those who want communism ism and collectivism he also misses that there is capitalism in usa especially for corporations when times are good but when about to fail there is socialism in bailouts and tax breaks that hurt communities because roads bridges water sewer schools etc all depend on tax revenue capitalists need to understand that yes they are part of each community success and failure
i agree with a lot of what he is saying the unfortunate enemy on the flip side is monopolistic corporations that rose from the era of free markets becoming so big and powerful that they become intentional entities playing on an intentional level while we and our governments are confined to a national level and cant compete with their unmatched greed  they own all of the assets and companies  power companies railroads and their next agenda is to own every property in the entire planet  they literally have plans to pretty much own everything and rent it back to you the gr8 reet  then of course they are pushing what he is saying will be the nail in the coffin complete socialismtotalitarian rule  they are so intentionally powerful at this point i not really sure what could be done to ensure freedom and free markets i personally feel a little hopeless on that front
it is true the owning class wants to own it all however doubling down on individualiat economics will further entrench the owning class and emiserate the vast majority of peoplethe fundamental relationship of owners and workers needs to be destroyed because that relationship is what is causing these woes
well said finally some common sense
this is the new dwfinition of courage  way to go mister salmon you swam against the current under the gaze of mesmorisez hungry bears who just watched you without slapping you with their paws nor did they attempt to  gnaw at your flesh
wow all my respect to this brave man have you noticed how the lights on the audience is turned off so we cannot see who is participating are they worried that we are now alert of what they do and no longer trust them are they worried to be recognised by the public if so why
yes  finally a leader that gets it freedom is better  than collective milton friedman  could not have said it better
revolutionary
i agree with the first guy he says it for me  and meny others  wef should be kept at a distance and a close eye should be kept on its founders and be put on a watch list  along side meny others who dont speak but act against the norm  we in the uk have left the eu  but are being dragged into a fare warse this guy held it for mei agree with him with all my heart
bravo  
thank you  well saidi sure hope people finally choose to wake up and pay attention otherwise get your affairs  in order and make peace with your choice
so why are the most liberal countries  the wealthiest  us was never a liberal government yet our stile of capitalism is not working
i think that being on wef is already huge red flag and not much gonna change in argentina
im surprised those wef toads let him talk they most likely didnt expect to be embarrassed
good spich
wef going down
woo ready for socialism
the truth is being told 
how could anyone say anything bad about a actual real intelligence persontrying to censor anything someone has to say is plain dictatorship
buy bitcoin
he gives us hope may he stay strong and healthy 
great man argentina people are so lucky to have this guy as their leader they should make him a king for life
how bulshit is that haha
how was he allowed to give this speech in that forum
ha ha ha
he is a puppet like the others
what the fuck i didnt think i would ever hear a rational person as a wef speakerit is also a very nice example of ai use
i totally agree 
its usually an all or nothing argument from both extremes the argument he puts forth which is basically adam smiths  invisible hand  from the 1800s which claims to produce wealth and equity for all is bullshit without reasonable oversight as needed without oversight things like slavery and events like the great depression would still be occurring argentina is has been a roller coaster shit show for a variety of reasons outside of government regulation and policy and there seems to be no end in sight which their president also seems blind to
perhaps the people hes talking about will listen or perhaps not it seems from their past decisions and plans they dont actually care
viva javier 
this is the worst the world has ever been
what is with all the editing of the video why couldnt you just play it straight through 
outstanding
democrats need to listen to this
lets start a serious discussion about the fallacious¬†argument about capitalism lifting people out of poverty it is propaganda not because it is false its a factual statement it is propaganda because the issues it leaves out just to cite a few1 ap 3 july 11 2023 the un warned monday that at the current rate of global progress 575 million people will still be living in extreme poverty and 84 million children wont be going to school in 2030  and it will take 286 years to reach equality between men and women this las point justifies the feminist issue of fighting for equality2 bloomberg oct 9 2019 at 904 africa may have 90 of the worlds poor in next 10 years world bank says africa holds 75 of the poorest countries its estimated that by 2030 will be home to 90 percent of the worlds destitute children 3 joseph peter 2017¬†the new human rights movement reinventing the economy to end oppression the market economy is based on cyclical consumption and it really doesnt matter what is being produced how it is being produced or why if demand or production slows so too does the movement of money and when this happens the economy contracts systematically reducing the standard of living for many economically this means capitalism is structurally oblivious to humanitys existence on a finite planet the system wants to produce not conserve in fact if you think about it you will discover an interesting paradox to market logic the fact that¬†capitalism is a scarcitybased economic system that actually seeks infinite consumption there are many more studies that contradict the well known propaganda are now accesible in the web its just a matter of wanting to find out the true facts and not be fooled
please diligently pray for continued divine protection of this man  a brave  just man always stirs up the wrath of evil enemies
once trump is in office we need to adopt argentina and turn them into a powerhouse we need a strong ally in south america
may we get a post of the original version here  i have twitterx blocked and would like to see this speech unedited  thank you
owr  unsware to wef is  no  
god bless the president of argentina well done you voted well please pray for the usa
why is this video chopped up
cut video propaganda
i am packing my bags for argentina
bravo
excellent presentation
javier milei is a brilliant man i never ever thought that a nation like argentina would be giving advise to a prosperous nation like the usa
share this video with everyone you know that is my comment this man speaks from his soul and speaks for most of us 95 of us to be exact
wow
this is so true even if richers get super rich even if there is a huge gap between poor and rich the poorest in a rich country has a quality of life 10 times better than the poorest in a socialist society if he is not dying of hunger already the downward spiral can also be seen in the venezuelan case where almost 20 of the population left the country to escape socialism and avoid hunger  in a country rich in oil and natural resources
milei is my new hero
like what this guy says
nonetheless it was an amazing speech
beware of wolves in sheep clothing
should be awarded the nobel prize in economics
excellent speech
i will sign up for his leadership over klaus and the boys
love this guy truth
hope aoc listened and take heed of what was said in this awesome speech whether she has the mental capacity to understand what was said  is a different thing
he missed out muslims
what a baloney title for a video bla bla bla
sounds like a giant copypasta from pol
i wonder if he will be involved in a fatal accident of some sort well its too late we all heard the great man speaking what √† leader but he aint getting the falklands back
this looks ai generated look at his mouth moving in a unnatural way
quite the opposite of what media is portraying him as i must say rather impressive we in norway handled our economy better but we are seeing signs of how our social democracy is ruining businesses our currency has never been lower
they already know that and pretty well by the way they just dont care and it is not in their plans
this guy is zelensky 20good luck argentinayou are in big trouble
companies do not go bankrupt if they are big enough capitalism for the poor socialism for the rich
he speaks very good english most of this will probably go over their heads
frazad i really like your motto as well as what you are promoting thank you
i love this guy
this man is outdated and ignorant serving monopolies and elites be aware argentina you are up for grabbs
amen sir thank you you nailed it
what a big win for argentina america need a big win like this and it must last more than 4 years for true change european countries also need this type of leader
brilliant
we are not knowledgeable enough to understand his arguments without counter arguments of the experts from the other side of the ideological divide
that was one of the best truthful speeches ever 
the second hero i heard a speech from at davos ill bet the next year the mics will be in control behind the screens people thats us wake up this circus has to go down
he swallowed a recorded tape
nice i like the ai voice over which application or software you used for this please reply
lord protect this man  i know the devil is working hard to get rid of him
it seems to me humans being responsible for themselves and trading privately between each other is the only uninfluenced manner in which to be respectful and comfortable here i hope for a space with no need of governing the people do their lives their way we would help each other if there were no agency claiming to be that help
a refreshing change from the usual leftist totalitarian rhetoric
this guy for sure backed by the us has yet to open his eyes to us decline gdp per capita means little when most of those citizans see their lives go from bad to worse not to mention that this big model that is the us growth is based on neocolonizing and exploitation of most of the rest of the whole world more i say that socialism or comunism could never really be measured as those nations who prize commun good of all its citizans and not its elites were never allowed to perform free of bullying sanctions from capitalistic bullying us
love it
but then we have those eugenics who want to depopulate the world and have who is left to serve them  wrong  there is only one god and i worship him
very randian
finding it hard to trust politicians because the elections world wide are rigged i love what this man said but he is a politician is this not just another paid actor here in africa food prices have increased by more than 50 and no ones income grow by any mentionable amount i just dont see this wealth he is talking about just saying
congrats to you president milei  god bkess you
my hero

freer richer and more prosperous i think theres people who work full time and still need to use food banks who would disagree with you thats a single example  freer markets just means i can pay my employees less and provide less standard of service legally
no sympathy there  argentina gave a safe haven for escaped nazis from europe
president of argentina is hero of our time bravos all people good will love you and all world evil hate you
his history is fubar but all we need for free markets is fair taxes the irs is sneaking the luxury tax back in good for us
why isit being cut youtube need to stop there shit
free market capitalism destroyed the planet made 000005 rich as fuck and the rest of us poorer and poorer i dont know what kind of system could be better but i cant listen to this crap yeah we have the most stuff in the history of humankind but we also never been more enslaved stressed controlled brainwashed overstimulated played with lied to and destroyed both mentaly and phisically these times are the biggest irony ever  we never been worse while also never having it easiermore
1426 ah yes the biggest problem of our timeabortion rights and climate change 
omgdid he make it outtaq there he just called out everyone the room let them eat the bugs
im up for a fair appraisal of the successes of free market capitalism but this is just drivel its propaganda that doesnt address the concerns that people have about problems in capitalist systems such as those relating to human psychology taxation and corporate governance yes free markets are wonderful when the incentives are aligned correctly but therein lies the problem its not heroic to maximize the value of your csuite stock options at the expense of consumers and employees its villainy
nobel prize 
yes and nosome rights are needed like demanding goods to meet certain standardscar producers would not place belts in cars if state did not force them to do itor they would gladly take 100 of market and than rise prices 100 becose there is noone to sell cheaperectbut exempt this guy is based
wonderful speech
im moving to argentina europe has gone mad us also mad
thanks
my hero may people heed your splendid words
fake comments
wow  that is something i did not expect the truth 
the adoption of free market policies by countries such as the us and uk halted growth rate in stats such as real wages in those countries it is easy to see that there are nuances to capitalism and it needs to be controlled this is a charicature like view
breaking the internet because he called the wef capitalists heros
wow he needs to talk with teamkennedy  robert f kennedy jr
msm says he a nut job i say hes on the ball perhaps our so called leaders should take note
neoliberalism failed look us and all western europe countries all failed
they still didnt get it
thank you thank you for standing up for freedom of capitalism
thank goodness there are people like him wise and brave enough to tell the truth at wef congrats argentina
capitalism babby capitalism
looks like ai to me
ai was used to make him say it in englishfuk me future came and i still have backlog of games from 2019 to play
protect this man
1437 he actually said the bloodthirsty agenda of abortion when he delivered the speech in spanish not the controversial agenda of abortion rights
its not just capitalism its science that has produced benefits free capitalism breeds massive inequality without some form of intervention by governments to stop the natural greed of human beings
free markets hurt the feelings of the protected elite class whom thinks they are better than you peasants but that doesnt hold up under scrutiny or free markets we must have socialism to protect the rich lol
we need people like him and bolsonaro brazil
what about chinas phenomenon of economic growth
a bomb has been dropped well feel the shock wave soon guys
thank you for this speech and your correct in that the problem with the liars in power and their corruption of every institution including the catholic church not with capitalism capitalism is meets the needs of the people and rewards them that serve that people
capitalism and free market   biggest problem with those are the hidden costs costs not  expressed in the prices like eg environmental costs costs in human health  and damages to the atmosphere ecosystems etc   with greed running free a cynical way to view capitalism but as it brings about welfare greed is good and no incentives or pushes to incorporate the hidden costs in product prices any economic system will ultimately destroy its own habitat as incentives to coexist with it are normally lackingonly when regulated in such a way that hidden costs to the planet ecosystems etc are incorporated in prices the calculated costs of products the capitalist system will be sustainable  will indeed lift up humanity as a whole and when not regulated ie hen we as humanity do not find a way to incorporate hidden costs in prices ultimately free market capitalism will bring about humanitys doom and cause lots of problems like eg clean air only for the people able to afford it exploding costs of healthcare so healthcare again for the relatively wealthy etc etc only when the free market capitalistic system is implemented in such a way that all costs are incorporated in prices that capital iswill be assigned to production in a sustainable way and then indeed it is a system that is far superior to any other imaginable system for bringing about creating welfare decent even luxurious living for most if not all peoplethat 15 always become aa lot richer 85 achieves common levels of wealth seems inevitable as ot is the case in any systemcapitalist or socialist or etc
we need people like him and bolsonaro brazilreply
amen
what i know the internet already been broken since respberry pi on the market
the world needs to wake up thats it push back otherwise the sheep will continue to feed upon the trash that is given them dont look to leaders to save us we have the power
article 1 section 10 clause 1the state shall not coin anything but silver and gold as tender and payment of debt
the free market achieved this by a sacrifice which is our health and  the health of our nature capitalism is not the answer and free market isnt either and we can see it clearly now the gap between rich and poor has been growing bigger and bigger over the last decades it is only a matter of time before it collapses this system only works if there is an infinite amount of resources and cheap labour
warch the australians amani in his video clip
good for him
wonderful good luck bringing argentina freedom again hope you can bring it back to brazil too we are admiring you from the us also as we sit under an oppressive us government not being led by its people any longer
yes yes yes
a speech which should be sent to everyone in the world 
ai was used to translate it so can any spanish speakers confirm this is what he said honestly i expected more screaming and swear words
i feel he just put his head on the the chopping block we need more people like this but the people behind the wef will most likely not let this stand since he is in this lions den of socialists and neo communists calling them socialist and neo communists is not a complement in fact its a slam on their illegal take over of the world they are illegally using a model of social engineering to control every person on this planet the science they have created  and use is slowly moving everything and everyone to a bondage reality your country wont be in charge but will be under the wef freedom is opposite of socialism and communism and government imposed laws freedom is personal responsibility for self family and community in all areas of life socialists and neo communists do not take up responsibilities as adults should and only take handouts from a government those corrupt in power promote the idea of government dependence to grow the government to have greater control lazy people meet with free handouts from government equals more laws the elite want more control over you you are willing to give up freedoms to be lazy this is no way to live the us is at the tipping point of defaulting on its monetary system from all the billions of handouts this is the plan of the elites involved with the wef which i turn are over your government and in your government the us is no longer a democracy people we are going down fast into collective and personal bondage what can we do start by getting rid of esg which stands for environmental social and governance this is often called sustainability in a business context sustainability is about the companys business model ie how its products and services contribute to sustainable development but its not on an even playing field esg encompasses diversity and inclusion which is another socialist psyop social engineering is manipulation over us all be awake and not woke i pray that this man lives and makes an impact against all of those in power that are plotting against you and i
only 5  of the world lives in poverty really that would be nice
he makes me ready to move to argentina
nothing but an american glove puppet
finally
the good thing is that no one is required to participate in any system political religious or otherwise just because you are born on earth you dont have to be a citizen of any nation just because youre born on earth you dont have to pay taxes just because youre born on earthyou dont have to participate in any system just because youre born on earthyou dont have to give up any of your natural born rights as a human just because youre born on earth
the wef being attacked from within their memmbership or guests
wowjust wow
bet canada is outpacing argentina in the downward spiral with the turd and its minions at the helm at a much much faster rate
thank you for your speech its just more white on rice too bad not everybody eats rice they would know whats right
he is totally right
the video looks sketchy as a lot of times i see the image of the person glitch  i dont trust anyone anymore whatever they say they are all been paid to say things and manipulate peoples minds as romans did  divide and conquer bread and spectacle
the man is a hero to humanity
this man is a god
im a little confused the wec is talking about freedom  i must be missing context
i believe capitalism is great but without the coercive government to regulate and tax and reinvest in infrastructure health services and judicial accountability it would look like oligarchic russia  all for a free market but national citizens have roll to maintain equal access to resources and rights because a business has no interest in either
we are a suppressed country feels like we have been amputated from our reality but still having phantom pain
i love how he spoke about the coercion of taxes taxes are theft
 he simplified everything
critic of the capitalist economy is not only limited to what he talks about its the system that doesnt take into account limited resources and environment that is why we see arctic ice melt thats why we see total climate collapse because quoted capitalism is not incentivised to care what is good for workers  individuals people in general animals  climate etc etc the only thing that matters is profit regardless of the total cost that we all pay with increased sickness rates like all types of cancers allergies etc polluted rivers and oceans micro plastic and millions of other adverse effects of uncontrolled growth  what he says is literally what a politician would say 150 years ago overwhelmed with industrial revolution and without any clue what are the consequences what he says is total nonsense in 30 years there will not be twice better situation for millions people  taken out from poverty by amazing capitalism  in 30 years we will witness billion of people being climate refugees because their current countries are unliveable due to extreme temperatures for most of the year the individuals like him only mud the water of public discourse and spread stupid and false propaganda look around yourself ask questions and realise how screwed we are if people think his way instead of implementing immediate emergency measures to try to save what we can still do
bravo what a man 
mega dittos
rising gdp is the explanation of inflation we are in the cancer stage of capitalism companies but each other vs competing there needs to be a combination of economic policies no one economic system works this guy is speaking as if he is good and saying this is the only way its a load of crap
psalm 1 says it all1 blessed is the one    who does not walk in step with the wickedor stand in the way that sinners take    or sit in the company of mockers2 but whose delight is in the law of the lord    and who meditates on his law day and night3 that person is like a tree planted by streams of water    which yields its fruit in seasonand whose leaf does not wither    whatever they do prospers4 not so the wicked    they are like chaff    that the wind blows away5 therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment    nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous6 for the lord watches over the way of the righteous    but the way of the wicked leads to destruction
while he has some truth we must also consider the limited resources and the chance that people may fail in their life due to reasons outside of their control therefore the truth should be somewhere between market capitalism and socialism it is just a matter of balance what is bad is doing one of them to the extreme so no his attempt wont work unless they keep up some kind of social net
problem is that the end game of the free market capitalism is monopoly which is not far from feudalism
this man speaks truth we must all resist the wef great reset everywhere always
most of the western media tells us this man is insane but among all the wef figures i have heard so far he makes the most sense
katt williams broke the internet no one heard this speech
broke the internet what a tit
milei is great but its hard to trust an altered video
the state is not the solution  it is the problem  no truer words have ever been spoken
there was no year zero obviously no research done
love him its so good to see some speak up in the corrupt wef
i dont like the edit 
unfortunately a one size fits all strategy is unworkable what collectivist views is he referring to
excelente bravo
what a speech tee need more leaders like this in the world 
god bless this man
white hat
i love this guy
elvis sideburnsdo people realy believe any of these puppets of the world elites
gdp growth is tightly connected with energy consumption its nearly one to one correlation meaning that when we double a value of gdp  about 27 years needed with only 3 gdp annually we also double energy usage new energy only add to existing supply and never replace previous methods coal is still used today as well as solarwind power that trend is exponential for both gdp and energy consumption meaning that in couple of hundred years with  only 3  annual growth we will need more energy than the sun in a thousand years we would need something like the total energy of our galaxy and so on and so on nobody seems to understand and care think about the current situation with mathematical approach and people could never understand the dynamic nature of exponential growth this will kill not only us but also this planet for those who argue that technology and science will make it possible i would propose to read and understand what is the current situation with nuclear fusion the breakthrough is always around the corner  for last century we will simply burn the resources of this planet  as we do destroying the natural climate and eradicating all the spices i bet all the money on that scenario
ok im moving to argentina
wow they literally gave him an ai mouth and voice i knew something wasnt right because i never seen this guy speak english
oh so goodfrom argentinathis is milei
he will save argentina
the problem is we are already in a new form a socialism were not in a capitalism by the old sense they create a economic system were we have the illusion of choices if we were really in a real democratic capitalistic societies compagnies like amazon google meta microsfot couldnt be existing by their sizes for exemple for fair capitalistic competition microsft should be by law obligate to split his buiness in 3 entities the computer side the gaming side and the ai side and they should not be able to buy competitors to eat them or close them only see what competions do and use their cash to create their stuff otherwise this create stagnation in all domain scientific cultural economic etcwere slowly but surely becoming a tecnocray were compagnies ceo will decide want we can do listen think or buy because they will own all the means of production consomation culture etc and they dont want fair competions they probably want a system of social justice credit and coupons
thank you for telling it as it is its time for change
we in the uk need a politician like him
fellow canadians can you picture anyone among the elected liberalndp government delivering a speech like this one no word salad here about fixing the country through distribution of narcotics and tampons
benny hills new gig
summarized a key point boldy said in public inspired an action clear thinker
remember the words of the ancient greek general  wouldst thou have peace  then be thou prepared for war  milei knows history
i wish him well shall we ask if he runs training programmes  were all purposeful given half a chance capitalism doesnt mean you cant share help support etc peace 
well yes argentina socialism doesnt work when your politicians are corrupt as fuck no system does one could instead of making silly statements look at the nordics almost no poverty finland has zero homelessnes why  socialism with almost no corruption
wolf dressed as a sheep
can someone explain all the clipping during this speech has it been heavily edited  or did it happen at all i find it hard to believe they gave him a platform to speak on
100  in south africa all our political parties have strong socialist policies the ruling party the anc is marxist in its ideology that is why we are a shadow of our former economic and academic self
excellent description of freedom
collectivism and corporate and finance mandated governments are not true socialism this neo liberal corporate controlled statism is at the heart of every western government and especially the unelected wef and euthis is a million miles from the true socialist paths the illusion of choice straight from mouth of argentina latest american puppet
the world forum is not interested in having us out of property they only care to be up top and keeps us slaves
at 1347 into this video did he just say that he doesnt support the governments intervention for the safeguarding of womens rights
phony anarchocapitalist so far using usdollars  the federal reserve is the most corrupt central bank in the world but it does have huge military presence to punk anyone it wants 
he knows like we all know these meetings are a con game and watching these people speaking in dovos is like watching a charles manson parole hearing 
so what you are actually saying is that 110 of 1 of all the people should get 95 of all the wealth generated by the working class and somehow that is going to raise the standard of living for everyone  if you believe that i have swamp land for sale that you would probably buy
amazing
long live freedom damn it 
how come the average working young man ca no longer afford a house without paying the bank for 30 years
what the world needs is old fashioned weltpolitik from a certain central european nation
this speech should be studied and taught in every classroom on the planet at all ages   doing so would ensure the healthiest and most prosperous trend in human history and would close the door to the possibility of the next genocidal socialist experiment
he is making a speech proving how capitalism is the best system that lifts people out of poverty which is the undeniable truth but he is making it to an organization of elites who want to destroy us in order to increase their power and make us starving slaves who eat bugs and cant own land we the thinking people who immediately see how socialism communism has only lead to ruin and trades 1000 big businesses for a single government run monopoly know that capitalism is the only way to have freedom and the chance of success but the wef wants power above all things and they have limits against a free society im glad the president of argentina is with us but everyone else in the wef when he spoke of people everywhere having freedom and prosperity im surprised the wef didnt hold their ears screaming and start throwing rocks at him
wow this is a stunned speach he is totally right we are just flesh for the state we are slave of them we need a genuine leader that stand on all the world against this wef which is the inferno on the earth
and they say ai will take our jobs
the wef needs to answer tony benns five questions1	what power have you got
argentine has a brave man  governor abbot of texas is the only brave man in america
so much bullshit how come top 5 billionaires doubled their wealth while 5 billion people became poorer in the past 3 years for real people actually believe this ai propaganga bs smh
as an american i wish we would atleast change the phrases we use like land of freedom and opportunity to something more realistic like land of homelessness or land of owning nothing
who came here after allin podcast
i love this guy  such a patrioti hope his security detail is topnotch because he just outed himself as an enemy of the deep state
capitalism is usually associated with democracy   the problem is in order for democracy to work you need everybody to want to participate   there are too many groups that are antidemocratic that manipulate the system and take advantage of the trust and generosity of the population for their own profit
i disagree with some of his points but hes mostly right why is this ground breaking its common sense for the most part why have the wef let him make this speech are they on damage control i dont get why this broke the internet
every word this argentina president saying is 100 true i was lessening to him  more then ones looking for any fault everything he is saying the world better lessen and get read of socialist and communist
moving to argentina 
this idea of his has a major flaw while it is good in paper the flaw is the separation of the state from the free market you cannot have a fully free market because the owners will abuse the system as they are in my country where the state has put almost 0 restrictions regarding distribution of labor profitswages the wages are horrible no laws to force the owners for annual increase there are people with minimum wage for years at same company and these people are many the state must interfeer or else the distribution of wealth will lead to the eventual eradication of the middle class and a deepening gap between the 1 rich and 99 poor
lol we already have poverty save for that one percent that is waving around the socialism scarecrow so they can leech the 99 unhinged
i love seeing him off the wild man campaign guy to hyper intelligent speaker and economic ninja
well said classy man he nailed it
epic
this speech should be on every news channel all over the world
can he move here and be our president
great speech
thanks buddy right is right wrong is wrong great respect
small business owners arent treated like big corporations and do not pay the same and there should be no ceos making more a month than a worker makes in a year 
the economic forum just learned about capitalism
this is impressive  great work
collectivism of rootless  metropolitan bankers cabal serves interest of  their own nationally and race whic is barely 50 million population in a world almost 9 billion
thumbs down  my internet is still up and running hence i am able to comment here
right on   thank you 
the anc government of south africa can take a page out of this mans book they wont of course as they are stubborn lazy and corrupt so the country will continue slowly down the path of socialism that argentina did for the last 100 years lets hope they get voted out in 2024
reality is far to difficult for socialists
world had a system that worked perfect until society was made to serve a queen an a king then things got crazy greedy
great speech by president miles  kuck flaus schwab
100 based100 correct
thank you 
right on my brother
proponents of socialism say that capitalism isnt fair and it creates a wealth gap that produces poor people who cant get ahead proponents of socialism say that the fundamentals of socialism have never been appropriately applied and therefore it has not succeeded on a larger scale i wonder how many people have been murdered by capitalism principles when compared to the 100 million murdered by socialism if theyre both experiments wouldnt you want to lean into the one whos track record has a drastically lower death toll as a starting point for improvement not to mention the comparison of the poor under each which is a gap wider than the pacific
when the collective west thought it had conquered the soviet and the chinese it didnt realize that the conqueror typically absorbs many qualities of the conquered as long as the west was opposing the fascist systems it had to produce some tangible evidence of such an opposition
all people enthusiastic about this mandont complain when less rules and taxation will lead to less and worse public services and harmful products on the marketthe west is slowing down because other markets are emerging and claiming resources that previously only the west could aim to control and use dont believe this manhe is only looking after the interests of the people in his circle
i hope he has good bodyguards bravo
start with the censorship here as usual asking me to adjust my words which i will all i was gonna say is it wouldve been nice for him to have a powerpoint presentation it wouldve came off 10 times better i probably wouldve had 100 million views happy birthday youre welcome
god bless america
truth 
to the spanish speaking folks how accurate is the translation overall
milei l√≠der mundial
while this is a very cool ai dub im sorry that you still own tesla stock
ah i forgot what truth sounds like thank you
i forgot what truth sounds like
president milei you have the opportunity to prove your theories  you have a desperate country that needs you and hopefully  your vision  i am with you on this  please show us how its doneif you are going to use the us as an example use it as a warning  the americans there are not as rich as latin americans think  you will all watch as the wealth in the us continues to be sucked out of the population by the rich capitalists who are taking over government with their wealth
a quality producti wish governments could give me something to look forward to like that
i love this man  i hope he fixes whats broken with the world
i love this guy
spot on 
im stunned he was allowed to speak at length about anything other than the narrative
milei  vivek those 2 together  i wana see that talk
he and trump should join forces and create their version of new world order where everyone benefits not just the elites
were taxed and taxed on top of taxes  property sales roads federal state city etc with no choice where the monies go  and our country cant sustain a balance budget  please bureaucrats get richer while families struggle
this guy is so right on
billionaires are sucking up all the money  most people are poor
false opposition
communism and socialism only makes the state rich and people directly connected to it its amazing how some people defend this idea actually i know theyre brainwashed but all they need to do is wake up
let poland go out from eu  and become one of argentinas statesat least until milei is ruling argentina
this proves statistics can be cooked as one wishes here pure idiocy
bravo
well the internet is still working and this guy is still a blind fool is this even real
this guy is awesome
if you dont understand that we all are being played by this gov both parties we are doomed research klaus schwab wef davis meeting in switzerland schwab gives orders to a majority of leaders in many countries including us president and future presidents if you do not understand this you understand nothing but continued to be distracted while the agenda wheel moves forward for a society of you will own nothing and be happy why do you think all this chaos is happening
this is not a smooth video the image shifts and the sound jumps is it ai or bad editing
i am in shock how can ai do this well helps convey the message 10 fold
im wondering why they would let such an intelligent person speak at such a corrupt meetinghhhhhmmmm
facts sounds like the america i grew up in before these neo fascist progressive regimes infected our nation with their socialist political cancer now im watching my country become divided poorer and has lost its moral compass and sense of meaning and direction its sad how our success can be overshadowed by this current neomarxist disease
he nailed everything honest and brave
sounds like the john galt speech from atlas shrugged that book was written about the times we are in now and a man who stood up
the libertarian stance javier milei posits sounds wishy washy and platitudinous i dont think it is particularly inspiring or truthful that freedom in making money and setting prices for the goods and services be done at the individual level he makes a brief reference at the end to a main character like mentality that pervades lesser people in desiring their own bags of loot it is all very tiring to hear such tropes being peddled like they are gods gift
market failures do not exist hes 100 correct all of this is by design they get fatter pockets while ours get thinner
their growth only aids the already wealthy  look at what is happening right now there is no medium class anymore
well said mr president   argentina is in good hands  may god   jesus bless your country in future 
so refreshing
good man 
this speech is onesided as most things this guy do complete freedon in economics have produced financial crashs such the 2008 crisis growing number of frauded schemes and greatly enhanced social inequality these are the real causes of growing poverty along with military excessive expenditure and the global drugs question he kindly skipped these topics argentina inflation was very high indeed before him just in such a way to made the politic situation unstable opening space to men like this one after he took office prices doubled overnight and it would take a decade to peoples buying power to recover too good for the rich ones isnt it well to which people is he talking all these nice words to the top rich at davos thus it would not be difficult to put things in perspective
wish bill gates had the guts to support this mandont think so
and in canada we have justin trudeau destroying the middle class and removing freedoms
they dont teach this in school thats the problem
please protect this man
this guy is just incredible going directly into that den of vipers to speak truth  i wish he could connect better to the average joe as much a si wish trump could back up his policies with a bit more classical libertarian principles  i know milton friedman is smiling from heaven though 
however you parse the words trump has said the same things  those on the left want to believe the lies of the power elites of the left and their media  the left elites want a two tier system of fascism and socialism to be in control  but the problem it ends in a system like the nazis of germany in the 30s and 40s
love this guy
uhhhh anyone think argentina would be open to trading presidentswe could throw in a few draft picks to sweeten the deal
amen brother
simplicity at its finestlong live mr presidentlong live to freedom and liberty dont let communist mindset    control us and brainwash usrise up all against this brainwashing wef agendas
thank you sir for exposing the current situation and the tha davos intentions
the internet is not broken
he is a disciple of ayn rand
took funding from china
their fall is in their symbolism in 1950 gdp grew 166 repeating and over the next 33 years it doubles hmmm haha capitalism 
i love this guy
make argentina great again
you will own nothing and be happy this man just destroyed their plans to their faces lol
is that ron swanson with an accent
in some ways the worst feature of socialist thinkers is as things deteriorate from their policies they hasten to interpret the failures as evidence they need to intervene more
i knew he was smart and right one now i am sure of it he has a path to success and he knows how to navigate i with government in argentina back him up  before he took office it was nice for people to have things for free but the country just can not continue doing it and will soon collapse he will save argentina
i want ro move to argentina    that man is a hero and justin trudeau needs  a major lesson from him
it sounds like this guy read half of the literature on capitalism and made country wide decisions without reading the other half if he thinks that in a pure free market companies have his citizens at heart or the environment for that matter hes in for a brutal surprise the only thing companies care about is making money
blah blah yea hes brilliant but he never had to deal with corn pop
a realistic view of out present condition hooray for a voice of sanity very good
rubbish political dribble propaganda anyone who believes this needs to have their head examined this is what happens when fully grown adultos are expected to behave like children communicating with each other through silly little icons and spend hours watching mermerizing images of senseless irresponsable acts or simple minded messages than emotes childish responses
run away capitalism and lobbyists have destroyed the west these corporations have taken over government and clearly its not for the better
this guy is a shill under his 2 months reign argentinians are poorer than ever if i as a leader of a country was invited to the wef and was against it i would have made my critical speech from my homeland
free market capitalism my ass milei unfettered free market capitalism is about dog eat dog survival of the fittest and fuck the rest that is why california one of the richest places on earth there are thousands upon thousands living on the streets of la san francisco and other cities
as an american i say welcome back argentina
how do you break the internet  
so what about the disabled or sick do they just starve under the burden of their misfortune
you are our hero polish community love you
my herolove from israelviva argentina or something
very smart man
the fact that this speech is necessary bodes very sadly for humanity western countries since switching to semi dictatorship should now look to countries like argentina and in eastern europe for guide ce as this is uncharted waters for these people of the past free world
outstanding speech
why its skipping all the time 
its fake
ayan rand lives
wowcommon sense at lastcome on javier
once again this is a freemarket advertising talk that attributes wealth and wellbeing solely to capitalism westernstylethis superficial argumentation leaves out a lot for example the influence of technological progress especially the capability to use energy another aspect would be military dominancedont fall for this the main attraction here is its supposed simplicityi dont deny the merits of market capitalism but it is not the only redemption as it is presented here humankind should use freemarket and socialistic methods not chosen by ideological disputes but depending of the respective areas where they should be applied
argentina is very lucky to have this man as president hopefully trump and pierre can save the west
soooo are they deleting every comment that disagrees with this capitalist nonsense
down with the system the people are in charge not the corporations
another free market trickledown puppet in charge of a country they always leave out how the us had its greatest economic gains after ww2 when taxes on the top 1 was 90
outstanding
what he is talking about is not freedom but the introduction of a new version of feudalismownership of property wont exist without a state because ownership is a legal construct which would not exist without a statewhen we realize that all did already exist before humans come into existance we have to ask how somebody can own something there cannot be a legal transaction to make you an owner to become an owner you have to restrict the access of others to this ressource this is only possible by violenceso he practically says that the only purpose of the state is to use violence to grant a few the ownership of everything and leave the rest of control to themthis is a feudal state where the property is owned by a few but being rent to the masses to do the production the freedom of the few owners is the right to substract from the production as much as they want because they set the price for renting the propertybut feudalism is not the same as capitalism feudal systems were stagnant economies so what he describes is not a brilliant future but the end game of capitalism and the return to absolute povertyhe blames the west that it did turn to what he calls socialism but this wasnt what did happen about 4050 years ago in the reaganthatcherera and later the west did turn just into this direction and became stagnant because rent extraction killed growthat about the same time a very government controlled country started to make use of capitalism chinathe mixture of government control and capitalism created an economic boom outstanding in human history which did lift more people out of absolute poverty than ever in history countries which just opended themself to be a free market failed badly and drowned in poverty you cannot fight as a 3yearsold agains mike tyson in a real match you will not become a good boxer but you will be already dead in round 1this guy lives in a fairy world and he does not have a fucking clue about what capitalism is how it works and how to make the best for all out of capitalism
can the us temporarily suspend the amendment that requires the us president be born in the us in order to serve as president this guy gets it better that 80 of our politicians
i hope libndp are listening to this real leader and taking notes if they need someone to explain what he is saying ill have my grandchildren explain it to them libndp
i think hes missing the other ninety procent of the story here
everything that president milei is warning against socialism and communism is what my country south africa is forcefully implementing may its citizens urgently take heed and vote out the corrupt anc and likeminded parties and people and return to sanity
freedom of the jungle social justice is not collectivism nasty ir rational yanus  please respond
incredible
but capitalism is also the tool to end the exponential power of the central planners authoritarian and politicians they are the ones who prevent capitalism from working freely in this generationsalute to the new president of argentina for promoting capitalism
long live freedom
singing to the rich choir
and gs pays for people to be targeted on an individual bases and gives jobs to people who couldnt get one they only have to be paid in drugs sounds insane but i know it is true my family has been targeted for many decades 
looks like a harry enfield charter
capitalism needs to be regulated by inspectors in order to prevent profitdriven companies from putting harmful substances in foods  also factory farm animals endure lives of suffering because competition drives the more compassionate farmers out of business  this kind of regulation is not collectivism
i love this person and im glad to see strong leaders rise up thank you
put this man and kat williams in a room together now
well done a very brave man indeed to bring out the real facts whilst most of the davos participants keep trying to invent more policies that  collect more taxes rather than finding solutions that increase wealth obviously they have no interest in creating policies that create wealth for everybody most of these proponents would have their own finger in the pie for a slice of the actionwe are being currently turned into communists with ever increasing taxes from all around us so that more people have to rely on the state to redistribute the hard earned rewards of those that work the hardest call it what you will but in my books it is called communism by stealt we need to look after the weak not turn everyone into slaves of the state if the market system is left to work without the continued interference of the state we would all be better off reduce the burden on the people not increase it reduce the waste not create more avenues for taxation and commissions which require more people shifting numbers instead of employing them to manufacture  products good for you argentina you have the right person managing your country you will be the best example for the rest of the world to follow
he is saying what see and feel in australia and germany
i would like to hear it not edited
im certain that grandpa klaus didnt like any of that at all
bro hes right
as a brazilian brother i can tell this argentinas people have learned their lesson go for them milei
very well said javier milei he has the correct world view on how the world works and the way western civ should go if we are to survive thank you very much
1118 hahah good stuff
thank you very much this is amazing
music to the ears 
nothing but a load of crap
if you think immigration is because of socialism well its source is still capital based countries which are ruled by wild life protocols d like its on wild capitalism
long live freedom
if only the people of pakistan could truly hear and grasp the essence of this speech conversely it becomes evident that the ostensibly free and developed western world shares a measure of responsibility for the challenges my nation and country are currently facing
for example problem on africa is not socialism but crime and owerdose of capitalism as social system requires lot more power and mone on wild place like forest or exxtrimistic islamistic or tribes etc similar places its the capitalism that powers this places capitlaism is actually natural way things works on wildlife i mean if you  check it logically i guess thats what youl see d anyway capital based values control is still good thing but not uncontrolled or unmonitored for owerdose  and stability control p
the fact that facts are unquestionable doesnt mean we cant question the conclusions you draw from themfurthermore the whole thing is based on a false dichotomy  left or right communism or capitalism these are ancient ideas no longer suitable for todays world nor is there any reason why it cant be combined into a mixed systemthis is rich people ensuring that they can keep being rich
thank you you are helping to open the eyes of sleeping this is our wake up call share share share
wef knows very well what theyre doing 
truth
it is time
sounds acurate
thank you president mile  your country wanted freedom and prosperity may god bless  you and protect you as you lead your country
anything owerdose is bad  including capitalism p and the problem of todays earth is actually owerdosing capitalism i guess p this guy says we need extraf dose of capitalism and i dont think itll improve things in average
im sorry but this translation is way off
start calling it for what it is these globalists want us dead for our stuff that should be easy enough for everyone to understand now you need to look and deal with  them as they are enemies of humanity who need to be stopped at any and all costs they wont stop why should we
there was a lot of economic growth for countries that could obtain and exploit natural resources in particular hydrocarbons
im no anarchist and know that we need authorities and a state but less state is better way too much interference and pressing of thumbs on various metaphorical weighing scales all about
besides having the best speech this translation is awesome
good speaker evidence used are biased and missing nuances all in all this guys a lunatic
as an anticollectivistliberal minded and proponent of freedom of expressioni still think that this guy looks like a mad hobbit i dont trust him
a guy can always wait until he has actually done something to tell us how smart he is
come to france please as a president  can we clone this guy 
what he says about tax is absolutely right
a great great speech one every american should listen to
pure capitalist propaganda money is the new god
unfortunately this man and his philosophy are probably marked socialists cant allow people to experience the benefits successes and solutions of capitalism that doesnt fit the narrative of continual evergrowing government interference in the marketfor your benefit of course
he is my  president and it is the first time in my lifetime that i am  pride of a  leader milei  he has honor values honesty and works hard for his nationhe is a great economist and has a wide range of knowledge in many subjects   hes done more for argentina in his first month as president than all the presidents of the last 100 years all of whom were socialists and left the country on the verge of becoming a huge slum he is a lion that came to awake lions
i agree with this man it is evident that we live far better then at any time of our history but nothing comes only with benefits how are we fighting corruption and market dominationmonopolies that allow those to control a lot of aspects of our lives i agree that regulations could get us into a downward spiral but how are we fighting families like rockefellers etc
this world needs to understand this liberating and beautiful message
after his speech all the globalist elites present at davos gave him a standing ovation and klaus schwab praised him for the speech hes either controlled opposition or he somehow managed to change the minds of all the sociopath oligarchs who rule over us
bro you wont do shet the mere fact that they allowed you to speak and the fact that youre not cancelled or demonized in the western media means your not a threat your wasting peoples time
awesome
in a libertarian society there is no commons or public space there are property lines not borders when it comes to real property and physical movement across such real property there are owners guests licensees business invitees and trespassers  not legal and illegal immigrants jeff deist president of the mises instituteso end nationstates borders constitutions environmental protections citizenship itself they want a world of big owners and others who will own nothing
the powers of financial capitalism had another farreaching aim nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole this system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert by secret agreements arrived at in frequent meetings and conferences carroll quigley
1105 spot on market failure do not exist and if there is market failure check if there was estate intervention
where they found these delusional people and why they raise them high levelbecause they are puppets
true story people
i actually dont agree with everything he said just half of it he said socialism killed 100000000 people i would like to hear the data behind that claim i wonder how many deaths capitalism can be held responsible for
we shall see what all the hero entrepreneurs do for your people we shall see whats given back to society philanthropically net zero  some hungers cannot be fed 
oh no socialism i would hate that social healthcare social services emergency services i would hate this less of that please
the most important factor that contributed to human progress and economic emancipation was the discovery and exploitation of fossil fuels and in particular petroleum this allowed free capitalism to flourish and emancipate the societies which embraced it unfortunately free capitalism has been victim of human nature tendency to greed and power hunger corruption favoritism and wars are the consequences the wef is the clear exemple where corrupt and dishonest capitalists belonging to a kind of mafia clique convein to cohordinate their strategy to infect the entire world with their denaturated capitalism
that looks like an is generated video  dont be fooled
i cannot believe they let him says all this in davos now klaus and the woke investors are coming for him
i prefer capitalism off course but my eyes roll when they use the word freedom to cover exploitation and extreme inequality those have to be checked just like interest rates and aggregate demand for example those adjustments doesnt mean the end of capitalism
these people are not elected  they have no say in how we live
i only heard about this guy from mainstream media and they portrayed him as a complete whackjob while this is the most intelligent speech ive heard coming out of a politicians mouth in years dude is spot on and single handedly made firewood of the whole wef agenda guess they wont invite him anymore

does joe rogan speak spanish yet
all normal humans around the world hear this man loud and clear and know his words to be true but sadly the ones that want to destroy the western countrys are deafts going to take all the good humans of the world to make sure his words are loud enough so they cant ignore are voices  as of now the wef who nato un have only caused hell on earth  wars pandemics destruction of countrys and  economys affecting billions of peoples livescausing misery and 100s millions of deaths and everyday the numbers keep growing  none of them offer or do anything good to benefit  humans of the world  without them this world  would be amazing and everything would improve  for the better
look at cuba  talk to real cubans  communism socialism and everything the wef is talking about is the same  it does not work
nobody else annoyed and suspicious of all the jumpcuts
i amconfused what i understand as collectivism is that of the modern oligarch the political collectivism of the west the media collectivism andtechnological collectivism ever since this process started i would say thats when if you lived in paris berlin or london you had the same experiences your media is lying and never challenges the govt it does not matter who you vote for they do the opposite of what you want and the agglomeration of companies are now making laws rather than law makershe cant be talking about communism because we arent communist
who is juan galto
at last someone talking sense i hope peoplewill listen and change there  countrys so that will be blessed
well its just a sepach not more all bla bla
no it did not
smart man
wow
did he actually break anything
ai is weird
ai generated video
i can assume that this man just like t rump a few years ago did not receive a standing ovation after his speech
why so many cuts not good the original is also just 22 mins just let it play
at last someone with since i hope others will listen and work on making there countys making the right changes  good luck and be blessed
and the people who operate youtube are corrupt first amendment violators and should be arrested and prosecuted for treason
another puppet of nwo
i watched the argentinian presidents speech he was spot on at telling the davos elites how arrogant and antidemocratic they are we fought revolutions to get rid of kings they are out for money and power
the world economic form and those people involved are trying to enslave the world
sounds like a gross oversimplification
fascism and anarchocapitalism arent western values trade unions socialists and social democrats built the middle class in the west while libertarians have existed only to provide a guise for the rich to rob the poor
although im quite libertarian i dont believe that complete freedom is good for a nation infrastructure should be the responsibility of the state exclusively justice safety and military should also be state controlled institutions health education and shelter should be provided to all by the state but with free market alternatives fully available and unhindered by regulation and finally a regulation organ ensuring sustainability and a healthy environment for its citizens through extensive testing and research of products chemicals etc and their effects on people the ecosystem and other lifedemocratic elections should be 100 funded by a state organ and any external promotion or interference should be illegalall departments of government should be overlooked by a seperate department that is constantly changing its staff to ensures no corruption
200 iq
great speech by one of the most interesting public figures but please do not promote the use and by doing so the acceptance of ai  this is the basis of deep faking post the original unmolested video with subtitles
oh but we just need to create a few more false flags that will justify us destroying all physical currency so that we can ensure all people are controlled through our central bank you know and pitch it as inclusivity because there are some people who are unbanked  horrors we cant have that  we need to control all movements all purchases all food all energy eliminate bodily autonomy and natural god created geneticsimmune systemswe need to deconstruct the old world and old ways of thinking and usher in our ai centric luciferian circular economy system that is a counterfeit and reversal of how things have been  then we can call it our system  our government  our religion only  force an allegiance from a population we would otherwise be unable to control if things remain as they are today without these necessary changes
what a clown
so in other words we the vast majority are supposed to believe that we are better off falsely believing we are living freely while lining the wallets of the 1 of wealthy elites who poisoncontrol our food water land and governments 
all we need now is for this man to run for president of the us peroid
what about antitrust law thanks
wtf is he talking about
holy shit a prime minister capable of arguing intellectually sound or at the very least interesting ideas in a long speech format he is miles ahead of his western colleagues in this regard as a libertarian leaning guy i would certainly vote for him i do however see some flaws in his argument particularly on abortion also other social aspects than economics have to be considered in legislation i for example have a counterpoint to the the libertarian argument against redistributing wealth  as it hurts overall economic growth while its true in a vacuum redistributing wealth results in everyone just becoming less rich than they could have been as growth will slow down and the cake becomes smaller  there is one interesting social aspect this economic idea ignores and that is it is well documented that as inequality increase so does crime the causality can be argued but psychologically it makes sense that those who are the least fortunate in life will always envy those who have more than them if someone is working their ass of 10 hours a day on minimal wage and they see someone sitting on his chair making 10000x what you make doing basically nothing then no amount of free market theory will hinder a deep feeling of inequality and potential anger when enough people are affected by this anger they will riot andor ellect radical pro government politicians and thus hurt the economy therefore it is my belief that there is a sweet spot where you redistribute just enough wealth so that people dont become angry but at the same time allow for economic growth to take place i know this may be immoral according to pure libertarians but i think in the real world it is necessary as the end result will be more government either way  a pure anarco capitalist society only works if everyone one understands and 100 agrees with its premise otherwise its doomed to fail as the plebians will inevitably rebel against the system
absolutely spot on
this is pure ideology all the results this guy is talking about are not due to the capitalistic model but due to the use of the force threat blackmail and destruction of the competitors
thi is ai its fake
balance is imperative  as it is currently stands the rich get richer and the poor poorer  its not justifiable when greed of the few   super rich  affects  peoples basic needs   eg electricity and food  and water   prices  hurting  and depriving  the public of humane  necessities  its not humane to let people and their children  starve to death and to do nothing  consumerism doesnt  work at the moment because the desire for wealth    under the current model  increased the production of inferior products   products that waste  valuable  earth resources because theyre designed to break  to create more wealth  poverty  and not to last    quality matters   earths resources  are precious  and should be treated as such people matter and should be treated appropriately repair and recycling needs to be given serious consideration and soon because we are destroying  our whole planet with our so called   elected officials  governments  attitudes  of  utter  stupidity and lack of forethought has it never occurred to these people that basic needs must be met  then and only then can real capitalism flourish  innovation not greed  better to be clean and healthy  and selective than to collect millions of useless  throwaway objects that polute our environment  
master piece
this is a deepfake wtf you guys cant tell look at his lips moving wtf
what a remarkable speech from a genuine leader
heads up this is ai generated from heygen  thats what broke the internet
excellent excellent review right here unfortunately in the end capitalism leads to apathy and also in the end it will lead to our downfall wakeup people unfortunately our news media supports this downfall by false reporting with the actual goal of making money
send this to all your leftist friends so they know they are really working for billionaires not marginalized communities
the question is not if his position is right or wrong we have to ask if different economic models should be aligned along categories of collectivism vs individualism or statedriven vs free market anybody who read my book principles of liberty can learn why it is a distraction the true problem arises from disconnecting rights from obligations
free markets without state intervention
dont trust the eu
woke is a broken joke this man knows what he is taking about
wef has seats in the un we never voted for them to lead us yet they are trying to impose their agenda of owning nothing having no privacy and eating bugs on us all these aspects of the agenda are right on their website even eating bugs for protein they want the meat for themselves
did it internet was working for me thou
europe needs own politicitions like mellei to stands agains red green madness
telling this in the dragons hole viva argentina viva mr milei d greetings from germany
this is false news my internet has been working fine
a mouthful of truth trump right again
  president milei
1917 most of the country elite industry management and science was turned to dust by a brilliant britishswiss operation the country is dismantled under so called communist revolution which is not btw yet here comes mrjiseph and in less than a generation 25y brings that country using left socialism to a second economy and first military power with huge industry 0 unemployment rate 0 homeless people leading medicine and education won the ww2 and set the country onto development tracks for an other generation ahead including space exploration lead antarcticas exploration and huge help to most of the lagging countries at that time i remind that all that was done under a strict left socialism now i hope that mrmilei is just making the show while doing something else in the shadow to avoid sabotage not for greed but what he is saying here has no objective fundamentals 
bravo bravo this man needs to be protected he speaks the real truth
javier milei  thank you for spelling out our struggle and being a strong leader who has analyzed the way to prosperity for all  god bless argentina  from tennessee 
thanks for referring to him as a man  not a guy thanks
wef has seats in the un we never voted for them to lead us yet they are trying to impose their agenda of owning nothing having no privacy and eating bugs on us all these aspects of the agenda are right on their website even eating bugs for protein they want the meat for themselves
whats with a lot of words having been clipped  what are they manipulating  bullshit
lel this is totally ai how can you not see it check out around 910 how his face blits and smears over his glasses it sounds fake also
looks like a deepfake to me
about misinformation  the media is the king of that free speech is what it is  if you dont want it its because youre being dishonest
social justice leaders are actually leaders to socialism the people they claim to advocate for are socialisms unwitting biggest pawns fortunately people of color in usa have awakened and are leaving the political left in droves
why did they give him an indian accent lol he sounds comical birdy num num
wow something good came out of wef bravo javier milei
isnt capitalism that brought argentinas economy into the mess its in now 
farzad  excellent eminent in learning
we shouldnt even have taxes in the us
bravo we need more ideas like this and hear it often
nah hes buddies with them sorry hes a plant
what exactly do you mean by free market capitalism  as history showswe never learn from history i only see dictatorships globally  freedom is just an illusion
great great great president   he only told the truth and nothing but the truth 
yeah and at the same time he suggest another bs he talks about corporate monopolies corporate monopolies with unchecked power is not freedomthats not capitalism thats cartel we will not replace one evil with another just because it sounds better evil is evil
what ai was used for his speech  it not only translated spanish to english but also changed the imagery so his mouth is speaking in english
yes argentina is the model we should follow
the defence of life freedom and property that right there
who is john galt 
they should release the names of all the members of this group so that the world knows who wants to control them
excelente
a government is elected by the people for people not just a handful of capitalists capitalism is good socialism is also good but if you combine both capitalism and socialism it is even better why not adopt both thats why china socialism with chinese characteristics is doing better than others
this dude is living in the 1950s
long live trendom damn it
what utter bollocks
justin  chritia would sit there sly smiles nodding their heads yes in agreement
so of our media painted him like some kind south amercian trump
cool story bro
is this video edited with ai tooling and filtering iut some points
rhetorics are so powerful in politics and facts are so weak that he have to behave crazy to win the election now you see hes not crazy at all it was just his image facts are dull and facts about capitalism are also controversial because they are against our intuition
who are the parasites in his mind the ones who need support those unable to work the vulnerable who is he refering to does anyone know
something about this guy so un trustworthy
1010 video
what about billio_aires 
what is he talking about argentina that every time they have adopted capitalism have also faced a bankrupcy oh now i understand hes complaining about the fact that if we dismiss capitalism politicians like him will have no job and will not steal tons of moneywell no worry that will never change its just human nature whatever system you adoptof course with capitalism he will become disgustingly rich while his people will starve to death like californians
what an amazing speech im sure the clowns leading the wef will not invite him again
argentina was the worlds dominant power
argentina finally has a chance to turn things around 
very  eloquent wow what a fantastic speech
fact dont trust any politician reading from a paper
hes a badass i wish more politicians were daring and bold heroes like him
wow never thought id watch someone speaking the facts like this at the wef
no actual experience of having run the economies of a province or even a town argentinians have now voted in a man full of rhetoric my bowl of popcorn is at the ready if i was argentinian i would emigrate
hes missing the point that all men are not created equal
he wont get another chance to speak at the wefgreat speech
taxes are collected coercively libertarian brother you are living in a privately owned country with a private bank the land is only leased to you same goes for internet assets poor people are taxed harder because they have less negotiation power the country is a business and has to make do on your labour better fall in line or be put in a private prison and yes the state can use violence against you because you are on their private land you can get fired for no reason you can move somewhere else cry about it
powerful arguments
corrupt biden come with cheating because nobody answers this questions why between 2 hours till 6  hours morning president trump null vote but biden 600000 why when in united state of america so done what we will happend in poor and putin begger africans
so in essence politics dont work never really did will not this time expect things to go to shit great got it
i like this guy  side note its a little scary what ai is capable of
yet another deepfake
wow imagine how terriblewe all live 10 times better than 50 uears ago have electricity water cell phones and internet but lets focus on the gdp
todo estado √© uma entidade parasitaevery state is a parasitic entity
lol
this man is a worldwide treasure i love this
dont be so naive
capitalism has its strenghts and we should build on it and expand it not trying to let problems  they are not people anymore who have no idea about economics or live in a conspirancy theory win nothing in this world will never be fair and someone will always end up with to much power capitalism gives you at least a chance which the gouverment in the place where i live in  germany has reduced to a minimum so many hidden taxation and you want to give to them even more power finally this world worked well and it can be improved
dont get angry with reality clean up your room
i have expected typical neoliberal bs but this is himalayan neoliberal fascism if this is acceptable as a new era of civilisation on earth i recommend orwellian model as a solution
yes in 21 century we have corrupts un and hr we will have better peace and life in the world  without leftist shia islamisten and most important globalisten
this sounds and looks computer generated its glitchy and his expressions dont look real
per capita gdp does not tell you whether the individual is better off or not you need to take income imbalance into account too i would even suggest that some people are off worse now than when they lived in their pastoral communities 150 years ago because most of the profits we generate through our collective work are pocketed by a handfull of elites what we need is fair taxation of capital in relation to the taxation of labour
all he needed to say is that the murder of the middle class is destroying our way of living in detriment of a poorer easier to control less free social class
you can speak all you want but until you actually do what you say i will never believe any of it as all you politicians and leaders are full of shit you say one thing that you promise to do yet you do the complete polar opposite in fact citizens of each country do more good for the betterment of their nation than any of these puppets with a mouth
the second harmful thing after communism is socialism the third is libertarianism capitalism is not even on the list
what would be the incentive for environmental protection without government regulation
long live freedom  dammit best words spoken in 2024 so far
make argentina great again 
i guess he hasnt been told that the agenda is deindustrialization and depopulation
lula just pooped his pants
most stupid thing i ever heard having no hospitals schools or roads provided is true freedom no social mobility yeahno this is basically a cast system youre born into wealth great buy yourself a good education healthcare nutrious food mobility a fun day a the themepark and become a high income individual yourselfyoure born into poverty cant buy yourself an education so you stay poor cant buy yourself good food healthcare a home so you stay miserable homeless cant get a job and especially cant build a businesshow are people so stupid to not understand this very basic concept i dont think argentinian president javier milei doesnt understand this he just chooses to ignore it for his political agenda and ideology
the united tribes of  the americas once initiated the western  rulers will behave themselves
excellent speaking the truth to power
he is telling the truth and knows his stuff
damn thats some good translation ai
this gentleman expresses the same views as professor jordan peterson which seem to be in the best interests of humanity and the planet
shit starts to get heated at 845
impeach biden harris
gdp per capita says almost nothing about country development quality of living and certainly nothing household incomegdp  gdp pc has been rising exponentially higher than household income which suggest evermore growing inequalitiesfree market capitalism has been a vehicle of progress for the very few which then trickled to the less fortunate at the mercy of corporates and governments yes it was a useful vehicle for transformation processes though certainly not the most fair now that a large part of the world doesnt live in poverty anymore free market capitalism becomes an outdated model that only prohibits human development and living standards for most people
this is a nightmare we are heading towards socialism are you kidding me after 50 years of neoliberalism you conclude that were more socialist than ever this is upside down land and i need pills apparently
we in the us need a radical change in our government we need to expel both parties republicans and democrats and start a new system away from the everimpoverishing dollar and towards a fair for all not the communist way but the free equality that gives you back what you put in what a great concept lets get rid of all present politicians and start a new system
its a nice and idyllic speech i wonder has he considered the effects of trickle down economics its a cancer in my opinion that takes buying power and market power out of the free market subvertly using taxes companies get close and cushy with career politicians and lobbying firms we know what the problem is we know its effects taking someones money and giving it to a company that they wouldnt buy from does two things unfairy fattens the war chest of beneficiary comps at the llitera expense of their competition and subsequently anyone in their communities whod benefit from their business and so on the streams of exchanging wealth have been unfairly drained at an ever disgusting rate which we know is the actual problem but watch this shill imho try to convince you of otherwise i hope my faith in your understanding is well placed thanks __
bravo i wish other world leaders had balls to speak like him
this puppet is moving over to the us dollar and supports the zionists genocide in gaza he is a great actor  serving the ruling class not the savior
excellent real patriot  and rejecting todays world corrupted leaders leading to poverty ses freedom andwars
in other words remove blackrock and unions inflations largest supporters
swedish polican f√∂rr√§dare
this man is a hero i wish all of you the best of luck from a fellow human being
best president 
what a great mouth piece for capitalism status quo the fantastic utopia this will lead to is 4 or 5 trillionaires and a few thousand multi billionaires are every one else except a select few who wipe their rich masters with squares of raw silk when they use the bathroom everyone else will need to fight for food
world economic forum leaders are behind the wars they pushing to bankrupt america and to push the nwo
nice new globalist puppet
that was quite possibly one of the best videos ive seen in a while sure bet the one i seen coming out of davos
use subtitles he spoke in spanish with that ai bullshit hes voice sounds terrible fake voice and accent too viva la libertad carajo
i want him as my president
wef blows
there seems to be some rather wide gaps in the narrative from the 1800s lets talk about growth without accounting for the exploitation and slavery of the nonwhite world reaching a crescendo less the slavery more the exploitation this has been the greatest contributor to the western worlds growth not libertarian ideals just the exact opposite i dont support the parasites of davos but this guys speech is not the solution its two sides of the same coin
he is a mentaly chalenged parot that reades from ready charts but he is a good dancer 
this guy is puppet of big capital from north that bought south and plays failed state in argentina thill their capital makes record profit
hero
fine speech till mr javier miles misquoted our constitution which correctly is  ¬†we hold these truths to be selfevident  that all men are created equal  that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights  that among these are life  liberty and the pursuit of happiness ¬† he ended this important statement by life  liberty and property contrary to what we could think at first was he not justifying the doings of the people in his audience  successful entrepreneurship is noble and sublime only when businessmen have at heart the well being of people at large before their own this was not so clearly stated in his advocacy of capitalism we can observe how capitalism has kept till today many nations in poverty as in the sahel region of africa and other parts of the world by exploiting their ressources at the expense of these populations capitalism can become truly wonderful when it is a win win situation for all parties and not just a few hopefully that may be his thinking 
god speetsh
please remove the end screen its too early
this guy is a real nut  he gets capitalism mixed up with corporatism
good democracy  economic with argentine characteristics
to many humans desire money that will forever be their downfall
200 years from now there will be a statue of this man in cities around the world
as a swede i am actually happy to pay our high taxes for free education and healthcare for all while having a free market that has enabled companies such as ikea spotify volvo doesnt need to be this black and white great speach thou
how did they let him speak this goes against anything in their agenda
as he said we are born free and we are free
capitalism is what is destroying americayou got to be all sorts of stupid to continuously repeat the same mistakesits easy to be confused because he says its the opposite but america has been capitalist for decadeshow can you blame your downfalls on a system you dont use admit youre wrong then maybe you may then be able to regain your economy and support from your peoplelearn discipline patience dignityamong many othershave some selfrestraint before you fall beyond the ability to catch yourselfgood luck out there
problem with capitalism is its very cut throat that leaves bare the rich for a few middle class over works having the most suicides and homicides and the lower class suffer poverty galore in china and india where we see a community unison on values and principles that share their wealth we dont see a rich poor or middle class we see a middle class that is wealthy across the whole board economic and financial balance spiritual balance commune balance less crime less conflict less poverty the united states the pioneer of capitalism has no real structure and stability many great achievements but built on the backs of great suffering i cannot support this way of living it puts a much tax on the wellbeing of humanity its good to be contempt as a middle class of capitalism as there is great accomplishments being done but when its as cannibalism on all fronts a doggy eat world it shows too much pain on the frontiers of make it or break it some ways thats the only way to go but we see the statistics that numbers of successes dont reflect on their individual lives of wellness usa and western people have for instance 50000 homicides and 50000 suicides every year in our country compared to china and india dont even have 10000 combined based on their population and india and china combined makes up of 3 to almost 4 billion people while usa has only 350 million usa has 110th the population of asia yet double the detrimental crime suicides and homicides of their countries brag about the numbers all you want in this so called economical powerhouse it has no comparison in their individual wellbeings and wealth overall but this is predictable no matter how much you lecture a fool he is proud of his foolish ways and will remain that way cant help everyone but you can help yourself and get out of a toxic environment usa and the west is pure politics and toxicity
the rampant corruption so abundantly present not only in argentina the abuse of power for a personal benefit the unchecked greed and the selfaggrandizing ideologies like religions  along with the ignorance of the masses  are the causes of human mysery  not the communal responsibilities and not the care for the vulnerable he is just another lashing out mobpleasing populist  big words on the outside  shady motifs on the inside
how i wish we had such a president here in south africa
it would have been more fun to have a speech in spanish and a chain saw
mr milei is a brave man  i hope that he will live enough time to get argentina out of this never ending downwards spiral to misery on the opposite direction here in brazil our communist leader wants more and more state intervention and media control taxes the number of public servants increase and the private sector has to keep paying this poison bill over and over again the extreme left in south america provede that it has done an amazing job distributing misery and poverty argentina venezuela and brazilmr milei is a brave man indeedby the way could you say those words in red communist countrycould you 
i dont think its safe to watch this cause parts are cut and skipped over so his words are being changed either unintentionally or intentionally
free market is best for prosperity is true fact but dont forget west start it first then usa was closed from west so they both could grow now if some country especially with resources want to start it the stronger country will abuse them bribe their politics and not allowed them to grow due cheap resources  labor
i think this guy has just become a hero of mine
so in this guys free market utopia theres no exploitation no poverty have a look at the us the paragon of capitalism and the free market some of its cities and its population are worse then the slums in india
he is right only in theory unfortunately  the reason why 10 of most developed countries live better is because they are exploiting other 90 of people and their countrys resources usa wef eu knows that and that is why this model is not suitable for all the countries in the world if free market would happen then all would live like poorest people because over 50 of worlds population is parasitic for the human civilisation to prospect people want it easy not fair that is unfortunately the main reason we will all fail as a specie
yes more freedom no labor protection no social security no union get the children back into the factories lmao the state will serve only one purpose that is to protect the property of the corporates and occasionally bailing them out when when the system inevitably collapses
thats a fake look at 127  jumping frames  rofl
please dont mention democratic socialist sweden i dont think argentina really has a good history of trialling economic systems to be a good judge on what the world should do
yet hes speaking to those who say youll own nothing and youll be happy and forgetting hundreds of years of colonialism and tiranny
what is this and why can i reek the jumpcuts
wow his arguments sounds incredibly simple  as if it was written by a teenager who has just started getting interested in politics and economics  how tf he got elected is beyond me
lol at free market capitalism believers the rising inequality is the only empirically documented outcome of capitalism
viva
there was another one in french as well  and as a french speaker myself i was mesmerized and astounded to see this guy who could not speak in english to tucker carlson in his interview with him  speak in french pretty comfortably like this then when i read in the description that it was an  ai model then it confirmed my initial suspicions  and here we are with the english version of it  although that i respect and admire the guy for his courage and his stance in the face of the wef crime syndicate we should all agree that the scope of what the ai model can accomplice is truly frightening 
wow all i can is wow  bet on argentina
im from belarus and i agree with everything he said
incredible man i wish our leader in this corrupt country ireland was ousted for this hero
what a speech this should be shown on main stream news
at last  a president of a country that calls it as it is and who has not been bought or corrupted by the globalist with their evil agenda
sorry mr president but it is greed is good capitalism that causes poverty and starvation
the fact that he is speaking at the wef says everything about whowhat he is
crying socialist 
this is so true and very scary the nose dive into socialism in the west is terrifying and the majority of the pop are brainwashed
i dont understand a shit what exacalty he said that broke the internet looks just like another clickbait title
i aggree with this the west must change and stop this political correctness it is ruining what matters
ai generated this
caveat emptor sharp border
fake ai disgusting the owner of this video will remove this comment 100
mille for leader of the new world economic forum 
this guy is pure gold respect 
trust me bla bla the simple answer to an unbelievably complex world is that capitalism good even though the world is effed and socialism is the root of all evil thanks populist
and they call this guy el loco
translation bomb
great speech
bs speech
he sounds like he just learned economics pretty simplistic and so are his followers too
wow wow wow first time in a very long time that i heard someone speaking the truth so accurately wish we could get this into some of our leaders in south africa
16 minutes mark and hes got the west and its citizens completely rightwhat a game the controllers have playedthank you for you love strength and words
i just can not believe  such a leader exist bravo
as a counter pointargentina has just asked for the falkland islands againthey have never owned it soyou like capitalism but you want other peoples stuff for free hmmmm
this speech  this speech is one that should resonate in all corners of the world  this speech is one of the best speeches by someone from the west and the south who spoke about real genuine issues  there are things that can be adjusted a bit  there are various types of capitalism  one of them is that the workers own the company 50  one share  so it cant just be broken and the rest goes to the owner  everything can be arranged you just need to want to and especially you need to know how  but i dont have high expectations because i know that most of us have no idea what the man was saying  they dont even know what capitalism is  and no the social component is not evil  people are evil not systems  any system is good if properly implemented of course except for those destructive systems that are created only to destroy  capitalism is in reality a system of construction  but some evil forces were not so pleased with the wealth of the usa or the wealth of other countries  they want everything for themselves not for others  030 of people hold the rest of 9970 in their hands  which means its not 1 percent
i want to move to argentina
our corrupt politician who we vote for them they accept the evil idea of wef who no one elected and all of them are wealthy and beyond who travel in private plan they talk about environment or the food  population use

well saidmileilove your countryno politics
ai
a puppet of the wefjust another clown  run by kl shb
taxes are coercionayn rand would be proud 
again china proves him wrong by existing its not socialism thats at fault its your western abuse of any system like soviet russian leaders abusing the system it went wrong democracy went wrong in the westyugoslavia like china now did pretty good china even looked up to the yugo ideas but unlike china wasnt large enough to not get demolished by the west that didnt like a successful socialist country denmark alsoswedenyou will not find the solution until you stop putting labels on systems and look for the real problem which is the people in power and their greedy or selfish intentions typical bait and switch look there dont look here and apply the same standard here
thank god for men like this 
well it obviously didnt since im using it right now to watch this video
sounds like he is talking to 8 year olds
dude spits some truths
brilliant
seamana cu 3 octombrie 1978
absolutely brilliant he is 100 correct we need to hear more about neoclassical economic thoughts and challenge inflation causing keynesian economic models failing countries around the world finally argentina might have a chance of restoring their economic position
tommorrow he to will have a black eye
good luck to argentina 
another ledgend standing up for us all
no mention of monopolies western money in wars concentration of wealth and the misappropriation of taxes to government agendas starving masses across the globe if there is a right way to do things and uplift the worldwhat he speaks of is not it
this sounds like an arc speech not wef 
i think he might be the smartest man on earth
the west has never been so hypercapitalistic we are at peak capitalism capitalism has won whats he talking about 
oh one thing dude why did agentena become a 3rd world country if in 1886 you where the first world power  umm wouldnt be the free market capitalists in america that stuffed your country up would it oh i seem to remember that britain was a world power long before 1886 so you make up history to peddal your bs
truth with facts to back it up so much of the modern world is motivated by emotions fear and false ideas
forget leaving california im moving to argentina
cest pour √ßa que schwab veut combattre  la d√©sinformation cest plut√¥t combattre linformation   les v√©rit√©s
the socialist scare again this is ridiculous there are social democracies but there are no countries that can be described as socialist in the way these people think the soviet union worked
well done sir  spot on he forgot to say that the highest rate of external investment to the developing world was under the british empire since the us has taken over as top dog the developed worlds external investment to the developing world is less than 10 now while 90 goes to already other developed nations niall ferguson explains this in one of his masterpieces
liked and shared
my new hero can we clone this miraculous human being and give one to every country in the world
well argentina isnt socialist and its an economic failure id be curious if he believes successful entrepreneurs such as bezos are creating a net benefit to society when pushing for wasteful consumerism and destroying smaller business also what about all companies from capitalist countries outsourcing most of the labor to socialist democrat china which btw from an economic point of view id thing he would consider successful nah im a skeptic and i dont buy what hes selling
an absolute political giant congratulations argentina i am envious of your country to have such a leader
milei just restored my hope for humanity i hope he has a dedicated protection team on 247 alert
free market capitalism has brought us all the biggest problem man has ever seen  its called climate change  1910 all vechicles in new york where electric  the first solar power plant came online  now what happened to the solar plant and the electric cars  well the capitalist convinced governments to use coal  petrol and gas why well free market capitalism givernments cant tell business what to do right  when economics is the only rule you follow as this iddot says it leads to over population and polution as economics is the only truth javier  your full of poo mate when you forget what economics is it leads to bad outcomes that are now killing us all  free market capitalism is a failed theory pushed by fascists  pitty people forget the past as this iddot is  maybe he should look back at history instead of just looking at ecomic stats as i showed it was capitalist that gave us climate change  if free market capitalism worked we would not have the climate problem as the warnings would have outlawed caol  gas  and petrol this speach is typical of what hitler said in his speaches back in 1930s
viva la libertad carajo 
man should be the absolute benchmark of politics
thank you sir we will all own nothing and be happy can not and will not ever workproduce quality products and be rewarded for doing so
why does this look like its ai generated
butthe poverty is created by capitalism
if only he could have been followed by ricky gervais 
he couldnt have picked a better place to drop this truth bomb of a speech  the wef klaus schwab and those at davos really need to hear every word of this
the ai translation sucks
bruhhhhhh what ai tools did you use the translations where on point even got his mouth moving the right way
most brilliant speach i ever heard millon likes 
219 the last 1800 years have 002 growth that means the annual 2 inflation is the worlds biggest theft and ponzi scam
bullshitting for reason  ticket to nwo elite club for himself

georgia meloni really let herself goeven changed gender
i wonder how its going in argentinia since he won the election
what an interesting and different way of looking at what a success capitalism was
wtf this inequality champion of more misery mumbling on giving a lecture to the capitalist gods about capitalism
and swab is preaching national socialisme its in his dna bravo argentina
i am stunned they let him speak at the wef incredible
face cam of klaus please 
truth
wow amazing speech his last speech in front of the wef i would assume good luck and prosperity for argentina
le pib cest un indicateur qui ne veut pas dire grand chose et en plus cela a √©t√© cr√©√© en 1934 faire r√©f√©rence au pib avant cette date est un non sens totaleje ne sais pas si cest mal traduit ou si il ne comprends rien a ce quil raconte
were all just being fcked with its all a show
apply to ukeu and hes 100 right 15 are paying for the rest and there is zero growth their answer more regulation taxes and give aways to masses to keep them in control these guys should be taken on a tour of the ex sov block the worse thing is the very groups leading the charge and agendas will be the first to suffer and they are too self involved virtue signaling to see it
i honestly thought it was benny hill
suddenlythe future seems interesting
hes not spot on  hes right about true capitalism lifting the world to another level  putting all the blame on socialism is an outofdate left vs right view  monopolization and corrupt practices of lobbyist and venture capitalism are out greatest dangers  the state in many countries has become a tool of cartelism on the part of the biggest capitalist empires  as such the real problem is not the system its the corruption and dishonesty of its members  look at the most successful and fair economies in the world they are based on fairness and honest sensible government in cooperation with capitalism  i wont list the countries that are seen as the best and fairest in the world  any absolutist longterm undemocratic regime will become corrupt and this does not depend on capitalism or socialism  lack of honesty in both government and modern venture shareholder focused oligopolization is what needs to be tackled yes to freedom and true open markets but also to a right to provision of the basic needs of all human beings  once upon a time universal literacy was a pipedream  what system made it a reality  we can do this for all other fundamental needs we decide to include as a basic right for every human on the planet
he fails to mention that since the start of this frenetic growth we produced more waste than ever more pollution than ever more destruction of the environment than ever earth is our home and its not here for us to abuse and use with no respect for lifewhat is the purpose of focusing on growth when there is no awareness for the planet and its resources
usa has invaded 84 out of the 194 countries recognized by the united nations and has been militarily involved with 191 of those the holdouts only three countries have never been invade or seen us military in there country  are andorra bhutan and liechtenstein
more peaceful
a true leader wouldnt have anything to do with communistlike wefj milei speaks out what every based conservative redpilled honest person knows at heart
from the gospel of the capitalism how about not using both gutters and rather keep your car on the road power and capital both corrupts there must be governance transparency and accountability
if i were to replace the word market with the word god  this speech would make much more sense this creates a dilemma is libertarianism a political movement or a religion
said like a true populist 
now i know why all media after election was creating portrait of him being excentric and crazy he said the truth about current state of worlds economy but i guess truth hurts
bravo
his speech is great if there is no political intervention on the market our world will be much much more prosperous than now
dont know what he is talking about
while i agree too much regulation is a bad thing i cannot agree that monopolies should be allowed to take over markets and be unregulated or that there are no market failures monopolies have ruined the freedoms of other entrepreneurs this is basic economics that he is disavowing and suggests he is not so well researched in these matters
how was this guy allowed to speak amazing speech
thank the lord we have at least and at last one sensible world leader
as a 35 year old university student and future high school teacher i am disgusted at the ammount of communists in the academia administration thank you for this great speech
i love this mangod bless him and god bless argentina
why hasnt this got as many likes as it has views 
his speech is entire a big lie he mesmerises the listener with false illusions and fake theories we will see argentina in the future and we will see who was right
cant even continue watching we know that far right and autocratic govts are getting into power and this is the threat to democracy
habeck h√∂r zu
well it looks like im moving to argentina
wow
preaching to the convertedevery individual tied to the wefunderstands common values and liberty but they dont carethere values are for themselves wealth and controlevery wef member should be removed from positions of influence within our social systemsbe it members of parliament or any other civil servantlook at the union across western governments when using force on people to have a trial drug unless you have viewed the content ofwef meetings at davos you simply wont believe the plans they have for free peopleits time people wake up
this is the truth the problem is what can be done about these people who are pushing for world government digital wallets and that will become a chip implant and the loss of our freedom
never thought of would agree with this but i doanything better than delusional tyrannical patronising woke nanny state bureaucratic whimps the state how it is organised now is the enemyfreedom
this was a jfk kind of speech which makes him an enemy of the globalists and washington d district of c criminals
my internet is working just fine
why is he at wef
what a great  courageous man  they will not like thishope many of them sitting there  follow his leadimpressive indeed  he knows now
trust me this guy is standing making this speech because schwab wants him to be saying this the conference is called rebuilding trust  this speech is representing this oooh everyone shouts what a wonderful guy at wef everything must be good all he is doing is telling the audience what governments already know and yet still impoverish us he isnt saying he wont either he is wef 
youll never hear trump or biden speak like this  biden wants to create more gun laws and trump wants to enforce them through red flag laws and bypass the court system  red and blue play for the same team people  get that through your heads
wow this man has balls and a brain
fantastic speech i live in ireland i only wish we had politicians brave enough to stand up to these parasites but our politicians are cowards 
bravo to this man for speaking the truth to these globalists  i salute you sir

i lean on this
he is wrong about 1 partthe people in power are evil and have thier own ideological plan to control and subdue humanitynon human intelligence is here on earth and they know it
i guess argentina can forget about reclaimed back falkland island as milei stand to defend western valuein order words he just have to obey from the west
they know what hes about so the really important question is why why did they let him speak its like hitler giving a speech at westminster abbey 
i think its about time eu helped latin america with strenght of its economy and with euro and usa helped latin america with strenght of its economy and with dollars the main goal should be similar like it was successfully achieved in the ex communist eu members the good stable economic growth like in poland czechia slovenia lithuania latvia estonia hungary romania slovakia bulgaria croatia i am sure chile uruguay and maybe even panama are doing very good but most of the others in latin america need help to push their economies towards the much better numbers per capita towards the first world status i mean slovenia czechia lithuania estonia now got super high gdp ppp per capita similar level like japan or the uk all because of the eu unity same thing happened to puerto rico cause of the unity with the usa puerto rico now got gdp per capita like the first world country all because it joined the united states of america making latin american markets strong should be a priority for the entire west eu usa canada australia uk etc usa is doing good by making mexico their biggest trading partner thats a start
protect this man
is this an ai translation if it is its amazing
economic growth does not illustrate to value of citizens lifes our government should be in two forms like a peach there is a big seed and around it there is sweet flesh the sweet flesh is free capitalism where restaurants compete with each other and people pay lots for luxuries and travels but then there is a seed and this seed is citizen salary where every citizen is paid each month enough currency to sustain food house and local transport we should not waste tax money to investigate if people are worth food and houseing we should not spend money to see if someone is poor enough to get help we should all get citizen salary and only encourage people into the capital system with its sweet fruit flesh as a reward so essentially there is a world for exteme socialism and capitalism to work hand in hand with each other not against each other giving us a productive fruit just like the peach where the seed is not forgotten we all agree that all people should have the right to basic needs so why dont we implement a system that gives that instead of policing the citizens
100000000 fake
this is what media doesnt show to people
the affliction is due to poverty from a dysfunctional labour force with automation and ai the failures of collectivism will be amended
socialism is a failure to the world
no it didnt the guys a clown
mr milei least we not forget that china a socialistcommunist country has achieved economic progress 1980  present far more than any capitalist country has ever done
says argentina 
free market capitalism is only a solution if your goal is growth you have to be a gross ignoramus to believe this equates to well being this speech is utterly childish and simply wrong
chyba usa musi podregulowaƒá demokracjƒô w tej argentynie
show us the uneduted uncorrupted speech  how can you expect anyone to take seriously such an obviously heavily edited speech  ridiculous
without an authority to oversee the expression of freedom the ones without morality will take control human greed will win
yep another populist shit
baby jesus cries every time he sees  broke the internet 
and populism sadly strikes again
why is this video jerky why is it full of abrupt cuts and splices is it due to editing or ai generation perhaps a teanslation process computer processing in other words is it true and accurate or is it faked artificial was there some processing undue to undermine its credibility
poorly edited video dont cut out the word bud
this is a wake up call for all of us
my question would be why the globalists would allow him to openly go against themlike what does that look like on his side and their side
it is not difficult to say all the right things compared to living them out
wonderful argentine rocks  down with wef   thank you
well said and stated by a man of the people he proves that the wef have got it all wrong and should be disbanded for the greater good
well stated javier i agree 100
as much as i enjoyed his speech and appreciated his audacity and courage to say all that there when was argentina the 1st world power ever
try comparing this man with the likes of rishi sunak and joe biden this man gets it
a speech which should be sent to everyone in the world 
what is this guys answer to corporatism that is killing free markets example amazon selling their producst cheaper and actually loosing money on the product with a goal to kill a smaller company and buy it cheap and then after the goal is met increasing the price of their product it happens and it kills free markets
meanwhile 250 billionaires have signed an open letter because they want to pay more taxes to better the world lol this guys is so lost in another era bye
there is nothing new in this speech because it is a standard intellectually barren demagogic self serving faulty justification of a system of social production that relies on the physical and intellectual labour of the vast majority to produce goods advance the productive forces through technology mitigate problematic environmental outcomes reproduce educate and sustain the labour force sustain health protect the weak and elderly provide necessary but unprofitable infrastructure etc  that system is capitalism whether its slightly modified by humanitarian concerns such as public healthcare for example or whether it its closer to in reality never extant his more sociopathic ideal of totalitarian free market capitalism  in contrast to the social nature of production capitalism places command of production and allocation of its product in individual hands  the social production is therefore directed and used for the selfish accumulation of vast social wealth in private hands far beyond any rational accounting of the contribution of that class of people  anyone remotely acquainted with historical development understands that capitalism was a dynamic force for social development because it better suited social production than the decaying feudal system that came before it  capitalism is not freedom from the state  it has always relied on state enforcement coercion of society into conforming with the control and embezzlement of socially produced wealth  it is well known that the state itself arose as a means to enforce private control of social wealth  that is exactly what it did when it smashed and enslaved free societies of the indigenous across the globe during colonialism  his main premise that socialism is repugnant to freedom because it entails enforcement of distribution of social wealth into social hands is nonsense because capitalism itself depends on state coercion always  capitalism always relies on the state to also allocate whatever share of resources remain in public hands to facilitate private enrichment opportunities  clearly he resents the fact that the majority of society have managed to influence the state to some degree to provide some improvement of conditions for the producing masses  the governments he is attacking are completely capitalist governments but mitigated by social gains won in struggle by the producing class  to large degree they were able to do that due to the competing example of actual socialist governments  capitalists always rely on social welfare and only improve societal conditions when forced to by the masses in political struggle  argentina has been held back by what is now quite obviously an outdated irrational and harmful system of production and wealth allocation  as an extremist and a fantasist he blames disarray on the sporadic ability of the producing masses to win some social concessions through the state whereas in fact the development of the economy is held back by the self serving sociopathic capitalist class that maintains fundamental control over the state and therefore its protection of their parasitic enrichment that is simply enforced diversion of social wealth to private hands  his resentment of womens reproductive choice and environmental management are a blatantly selfish fantasy relating to the social position he and his class are in  their greedy state enforced position is reflected in his moral fantasy that it somehow represents the essence of man  the decay of western capitalism is exemplified in the social decay hampered productivity bloated scale of non productive financial swindles and general decline we see in the us as its empire crumbles  whereas countries such as china use elements of capitalism that still play a role in developing social production within overarching social control of social production and wealth distribution that is protected by the state  his rule in argentina will enrich his class while snatching back concessions  it will cause chaos and resentment until it falls in disarray to those who will attempt to repair the damage
fantastic speech wow just love his bravery
wow bravo someone saying what most of us think we all need to be louder
respect
this guys a genius
or are they just letting him speak to give the impression they believe in free speech  dictators rarely announce themselves as dictators
mr milei you do not understand economics youd do well to youtube richaard wolf phd economics democracy and capitalism can not coexist i doubt that argentina has ever had good governance  in a free society you have the right to  become anything you want as long as you are not taking someone elses rights in the process the rethoric you spew does not match the spirit of what you are speaking of  your less than professional presentation still may incite some kind of change and develop something new and needed
what is with all the cuts in the speech
make this man king of the world an intelligent polotician at last they mocked him when he got in but now possibly a saviour for the world much much respect for this great man  god bless   much respect  from the uk  
this man knows what hes talking about isnt it strange that our schools arent teaching anything important or intelligent why because teachers cant see it or dont care this man deserves the best
intelligent man 
my guy on stage looking like austin powers speaking the truth 
capitalism  is the cause of poverty to the majority
socialism didnt happen to you  usamerica happened to you 
this guy is controlled opposition
javier milei knows his stuff he is a professor of macroeconomics economics of growth microeconomics and mathematics for economistshe specializes in economic growth and has taught several economic subjects in argentine universities and abroadover the last 20 years he wrote  more than 50 academic papers by comparison maduro the socialist dictator of venezuela was a bus driver before getting appointed as dictator
my internet is still working hereyours
you know that they applauded him and klaus schwab was praising him
appzits not real  done by ai
bro speaks truth damn
love this guy
beware the wolf in sheeps clothing telling you how things are
youre kidding capitalism is the greatest failure we are surrounded by monopolies more people have died and suffered as a result of this ideology  we pay more for less of a service all utilities  communications  airline mining should remain the property of the people you are free to make your money any other way recognising business is not a living entity should pay taxes and face laws that are an actual deterrent capitalism fails when it cant steal the resources of other countries  what countrys still has a democracy
viva la libertad carajo
a poor man telling world richest men they got it all wrong 
f√ºhrer schwab will not be pleased with this
definitely more than just a man with a chainsaw lol
capitalism works it just doesnt work well when there is corruption
gdp is not a measure of the wellbeing of allsocialismcommunism may be flawed but have never been allowed to succeedcapitalism has always been about the gain of power  riches for the fewyou would think an argentinian would know this given their history of hyperinflation
just because argentina has 200 inflation means  the rest of the world does most places have 3 one shoe does not fit all
the working class is pushing back against the establishment i have no idea about his background but he got it right in this speech
the communist machine is on the move fr fr
quick all to the tunnels we need to have a meeting stat
yet it is corporations behind the drive for authoritarian socialist neofeudal technocracy whatever system is in place where there is dynastic houses of families that seek to control everything and have all the wealth  the majority of us will suffer their machinations i like what he said though and agree with most of it
i wonder why this isnt on the news
great speech chat gpt 
wow  best speach from the last decennia 
the truth
why is it only about the coercion of the state tax but never the coercion of capital why do i have to pay for rent and food its not like i can just not eat or live on the street
could it be that  1 they got caught and now they want to distance themself by condemning the very fact that they are after  hence regaining trust and play along with the mass opinion to gain their stupid trust 2 excellent ai
isnt it just crazy how all of the wef members got where they are becuase of capitalism and now want to get rid of it its called pulling the ladder up well said that man
i like him
my internet is fine 
felicidades por tu discurso un verdadero presidente para su pueblo y su naci√≥n esperemos que resista buena suerte
what a show wef is not exactly a stage that is shared with dissenters reminds of freemason gaddafi speaking at the un dont get your hopes up because of these puppetswef is after all building trust
i think this is correct some of the words chosen give you a different initial reaction but when considered in context he made a good first half of a speech its very long
you can throw that hot garbage of a speech away there is already a wrong conclusion in the first sentence socialism does not lead to poverty but is a main ingredient in the richest and most livable countries of the world yes even the us has socialist oriented government functions unfortunately americans are  too ignorant to even try to understand the word so now because of  propaganda ignorance and misinformation people are actively working to throw away that one thing that makes a country worth living that freedom he is talking about is another word for everyone for himself which only helps the already powerful
do you know how many times ive heard such right words but in practice look at ukraine zelensky promised even more so what what stupid people
fking amazing 
what a legend
wow woooo hooo thank you good sir  you have my respects  and i say thank you this is the best speech i have ever heard
excellent speech his ideas are very much consonant with those of ayn rand i believe hes an objectivist thank god
this guy sees the whole picture he accurately addressed problems and offered solutions for each detail in a very straightforward way i cant believe he was able to take such a complicated and multifaceted economic topic and put it into such a short speech very well done
bravo si dios nos hizo libres porque permitir que los gobiernos comuniistaaaa nos la quiten
okay that was  a lot to take in as i look around i think hes right
 a big applause for you  for your courage and political intelligence 
i the peaceful living spiritual man with god given rights and freewill dont consent to cbdcs  digital ids also i forbid the world economic forum world health organisation and their satanistic agenda any jurisdiction over me in the name of jesus christ my lord and saviour
is this real or ai
australia is in dire need of a leader such as president milei
just say there no democracy sucks in argentina period
corporations are n o t gonna like him at all i hope he has extensive security detail  intelligence
from now on his time is counted
looks like gary glitter
how can you discover a land that already has people smh
congrats to argentina for electing such a president the speech was flawless from both an ideological perspective and the vocabulary used the only problem is with the videos title which is clickbaity and makes the speech lose credibility
bravo you speak for many of us who have been fed up with the socalled western democracies whose goal is nothing but to control and repress violating our rights to freedom of speech private property and bodily autonomy i hope well see more leaders like him who can stop this tyranny
proper president
sounds like hes a communist any thing pleasestay far away from putins example of communist russian
this looks highly edited to me i dont quite believe it
looks like im moving to argentina
a politician  the president of a natuon no less  speaking truth mind blown
ai is incredible
what a load of rubbish full of contradictions sweeping errors inconsistencies etc he tries to destroy socialism by also inadvertently destroying the current us model of capitalism where 1 of the population owns 99 of the wealth did he listen to himself where in 2009 obama bailes out goldman sachs and the other vultures because of banking fraud capitalism for profits and socialism for the losses argentinas main problems are the elites who own everything and suck the life out of the economy now he wants to open it up even more so they can complete the rout and include us multinationals who will get everything at a discount now that he has devalued the currency by 50 a delusional presentation that only idiots will appreciate and fall for please people do your homework
the second richest country  has a different system from capatilism still life is good there
this is ai edited

capitalist countries have no cohersive taxes 
g gordon liddy is smiling up upon us
he puts social economic and kommunism in the same category as if was the same a sozial marekt like in germany stops companies from having a monopoly like in the free market in the usa he said theres more poverty in sozial systems as in free makets which is a lie just look at us homelessness and poverty in the usa and compare it to germany they want to destroy the market cap put on blackrock vanguard and other criminal companies so they gain even more power in the sozial economic systems of the world the wef only acts for its greedy companies and not for the interest of the people
its funny how easy it is to sound smart and sway people either way but we all know what the true problem is immoral corrupt greedy selfish and other kinds of bad people at the top no matter what the system is called completely unregulated capitalism in combination with those bad kinds of people at the top is the most efficient way to destroy the planet and ensure no future for humanity at all ultimately there is no such a thing as infinite exponential growth limited resources and laws of thermodynamics forbid it while free markets are a savior for countries in bad shape this is not a perfect system and hopefully we can improve on it
this translation is not greathe did not say by supporting the controversial of abortion rights what he really said in spanish is by supporting the bloody agenda of abortion bloody as in criminal
this ai is impressive in word articulation and meaning transmission
national socialism brought germany from rubble to the world super power in less than 10 years its essentially a free market capitalist society with a focus on community and nationalism
salut to you you are a true leader socialism always prove to  lead to poverty and it is only benefit  to the elites who want the population stay poor capitalism allow  to gives chances to people to be pune rich that problem is that this mean taking power from dies who sick power only for them self 
and look how press talked about him whenvthey voted him  not good at all they talked about him  now we knoe why and who owns the press 
this guy makes me want to move to argentina
research neomarxist theory it is the root of most of the modern problems
milei you are awesome i wish venezuela had a leader like you the people there deserve it
well javier milei became one of the three people i most respect in this world finally someone i actually agree with 100
my new hero
his logic is quite sound
how dare you suggest that people cannot be assigned unquestionable power as an government official to mooching on society while disguising as a greater collective good
just remember people president milei is not suicidal and would never intentionally hit a treebecause he is more rational and more passionate than that
were going to find out this guy is ai lol
the west is in danger because we chose to put dangerous people in office  we voted for them  if voters fail to recognize any facts beyond the party one belongs to we will continue on this path
just remember any negative comments always start with a criticism and this is the left exposing themselves in the very first sentence only criticize thank you for making it so easy to see you pres milei we salute you
its so weird to see margareth thatcher of argentina welcomed by argentinians with open hands and with such enthusiasm
what a fantastic speech well done this man the few billionaires running this agenda dont want us to have money they want it for themselves
my internet works just fine all lies
when tucker interviewed him he only spoke spanish why didnt he speak english with tucker
i was born in soviet union 5 years before it collapsed my parents and grandparents were working class and never in their lives worked more than 40 hours a week and had 1 full month paid vacation the education was free and one of the best in the world on top of that every citizen received an apartment in the city and a lot of land in the countryside to build a homestead for free from the government people never paid a dime for their housing because it was free right now i am living in the richest free market economy in the world usa and i have to work 6070 hours a week just to pay the rent and cant even save up for the downpayment to get a mortgage which i will have to pay for 30 years how come communismsocialism was bad 
bravo incroyablevive le nouveau pr√©sident argentin quon a essay√© de faire pass√© pour un hurluberlusun homme √† suivre
its just so weird as a brit hearing this argentinian speak and talk pure thatcherite discourse years after the falklands im a blue blooded capitalist free marketing conservative and i feel pangs of jealousy as britain the homeland of this ideology is headed with certainty in the other direction with an incoming landslide socialist government
great 
this is actually the bs bachelor of science in economics crash course    economics in 19 minutes    not the bs bll st econmics of wef   
so say we all 
no the internet didnt breakboring money talk 
he said it all im glad someone is speaking upif anyone thinks he is out of linethey must have there heads buried in the sand ive been listening on these matters for  while a little here a little there but this man put it all together he is right on because whatever happens with america its going to happen to the rest of the worldand the things he is saying has been in the worksbefore covidlong before time for everyone to wake up
this guy sold his country to the us corporations and now he talks against the wef isnt the wef running the us corporate and foreign policy agenda can see a us lead regime change in the near future
in usa you have an entire party like this guy  libertarian party of the usa vote them always
isnt this ai generated look at his glasses blending with his face at random interval and the weird way his lips seem to move 
the problem is if you like share and subscribe your esg will be deducted with huge points  you people are not allowed to think of anything that really sum up    
we the people are not your guinea pigs
so far so good i just hope that the actions will match the words spoken
wowwhat a speech  hope the west is taking note 
scary socialism when real issues is privatization and for profit etc
very educational and he is rightwow im impressed  what a speech 
why is this edited  1 of many unsubscribed
wow what a beautiful speech
bravo finally a leader talking sense based on facts the decline of western countries will be attributed to idiot leadership with no knowledge and dominated by greed and stupidity
not really  he just rattles down history and numbersa true populist leaderlets see how well his country will do
look forward to seeing argentina flourish 
from slovakia from the heart of the europewe only have two options in my country vote for social democrats or when worse for open neomarxists progresivistsand the rest of the europe is in the same sh western europe is lost technocrats finally have every needed tools to slave the peoplegame over
yes but remember that there was continued poverty in western european countries until post ww2 when democratic socialist parties were elected to power laisai fair economic resulted in the ny stock exchange  collapse and a depression that spread throughout the world it resulted  in  world poverty and an undesirable rise of national socialist parties in 3 european countries the post war democratic  government werent     everything  but most benefits remain in place eg the pension for the aged and health care there needs to be a balance to prevent people being returned to poverty
bro even flew economy to davos 
good job with ai lips and speech with an accent  
the problem is his facts are what they want they want everyone to have less they want everyone to live less and dying early they want less production all he did was reinforce what they want
good all the libertarians in the us can move there 
great speech now if only the west can again make it a reality along side argentina and give example to the rest of the world
now the elite knows what we think of them lets see if we let them get away with nurder 
yeah but he goes too far  taxes are essential for justice equality education and culture  sure capitalism is the way forwardbut the government are the corporation of the people and need to moderate all that goes onwithout overreach  it is a fine balance of government and capitalism  lets face it the wef are capitalists hiding behind the shield of socialism  everything they propose will not effect them at all  they will live as they like  unrestrained capitalism has lead us into wars look at the usa and their capitalist desire to control the resources of the world for their industrialists   he is an extremist one wayjust as marx was an extremist in the other way
no puppet here
stand up guy of course he cares only about the people
this is actually untrue the countries that are doing best or growing the most are a combination of socialism and capitalism the united states and europe are in major decline and its not because of socialism but actually unfettered capitalism that presently predominately benefits the billion dollar corporations the more regulation we took out of our capitalism the less it benefited middle class americans capitalism without regulation allowed corporations to take their production to other countries because it made more sense for their capital but it eliminated a large portion of blue collar jobsrussia and china are booming and they are capitalist but they wont let corporations destroy their nations the facts just dont bare out
why did you chop up his speech
fantastic speech
any subscription service is a move away from ownership we already have it with music tv and movies via streaming elon wants to move to an uber style ride share system for cities taking away personal freedom and property once self driving is 100 and im the kind of persion that would own an electric car given soecific circumstancesi will say i disagree with monopolies being squashed is a bad thing a monopoly stifles competition and creativity
interesting that hes there in the first place 
well said free enterprise is the only way to go
lets see how he goes
but globalists cannot respond openly the hard truth is that in the future lots of coal oil and gas deposits will run out and there simply wont be enough for everyone his words are nice for me too but the growth is possible only when we conquer the next planets
great speech communist or collectivist must not be free for venezuela cuban north corea china nicaragua and soon to be possible mua country please stop it and give the to the people the freedom to be their own best self owners of their properties 
well said
this is edited why
when this person has a speech on wef then wef will soon out of game  have a nice day 11
isnt this interesting the western is proclaiming freedom but actually practicing socialism the one which they claimed having been fighting against for years 
when you focus all your efforts on gdp growth above everything else of course it will rise more than when you have not gdp growth is now our main goal and we sacrifice a lot for it
he is a brilliant man
our real leaders are doing their worst to collapse the system we had it started decades ago into what we have now with no future to speak of
congratulations to argentina people   whose support this president now you can hope for growth and prosperity
is he furreal
im not argentinian when i saw this guy in the news i thought he was a clown im totally blown away by this speech as a fan of hayek friedman von mises et al i am starting have respect for this this guy
this guy is a sleazy conman preying on ignorant people who think theyre part of the club capitalism  freedom capitalism  servitude
hes a brilliant man
the free men of the west who kneel only before god and recoil at the notion of eating insects wholeheartedly extend our deepest gratitude mr milei
this guy puts joe biden to shame
i really like this guy finally a libertarian running a country thank god they will do everything they can to destroy him i will pray for him
i love that guy
this president must remain vigilant at all times especially following this remarkable speech  or should i say the martin luther king argentinian president  first he needs to be aware of potential threats from within his secret security who may act on orders from the elite second the possibility of poisoning  third the risk of a sudden flight crash trust me on this one  these are just a few concerns this remarkable individual should be safeguarded at all costs he has the potential to lead his country through a new revolution for the freedom of human existence however history has shown that even someone as prominent as jfk was vulnerable anyone could be a target let us pray for the protection of this remarkable individual in jesus name amen
in soviet union everyone was equal equally poorin the us everyone is an ignorant slave
well said sir from britain
i used to think  based solely on the western worlds routinely and demonstrably unreliable news reports  that this argentine leader was something of a wild man with outrageously fringe ideas i now see that he is actually an economic scholar and has serious ideas based on historical experience he champions what he knows works in the real world and advocates a much needed change from often wellintentioned but ideologically based and counterproductive policies much as president trump did i will take his ideas much more seriously in future
his a leader his people need his a leader many more need
this guy has no idea of progress 
well said well said
did he get this checked by klaus first lol
people are fd in the head for thinking this is wisdom his method has had 1000s of years didnt work yet use your own brain a bit
doesnt his free capitalistic market lead to mass unemployment whenk recessions hits every 10 years
a free market is only free if all parties have equal bargaining power else you get monopolies supplier middleman consumer else we end up with price gouging monopolies how can we ensure that any ideas
from northern ca im wishing you and your great country success  hopefully trump will win and help save america
que viva la libertad carajo
all the world leaders need to listern to and take on board what this man javier milei has spoken about
i hope  god bless
1000 people  100 every month cycle in and out of government duty 60000 a year must serve if randomly picked  end the legacy power just like jury duty
milei announcing argentina is for sale to the highest bidder foreign corpos and banks are going to eat it up argentina really abt to own nothin g and be happy
i didnt think he speaks english 
dont trust anyone talking on this stage
another excuse to cut taxes on the corporations of the rich and put it on the working man
new fascist are rising
broke the internet ffs come up with something original
well said
we dont have free market capitalism that time has long past also we cannot continue to grow on a forever linear path because there are limited resources eventually markets plateau when resources run out and that will cause an implosion of capitalism and a collapse of civilization capitalism requires never ending resources and continual linear growth socialism is the end result of late stage capitalism when the system starts failing as capitalism is unsustainable only way to overcome the unsustainability factor is to harvest vast resources via our solar system through significant investmentadvancements in ai and space travel go elon musk also we need fusion power dont make the mistake of thinking these elites are anticapitalists they are not they are merely implementing solutions to the problem of late stage capitalism as they are able to observe the cliff the system is heading towards  basically they have benefited from capitalism and are trying to make it sustainable by causing controlled decline centralizing the economy and decreasing population growth so that they can hold onto their wealth and resources the masses are using up too many resources and are too hard to control so they need decline not growth the general population cant see the cliff because they arent heavily involved in macroeconomics and therefore dont understand the elitist agenda the elites are procapitalists but antidemocratic they want us to be collectivistic and socialist but for them its full blown oligarchictechnocratic capitalism because that is what benefits them the most there really isnt an argument of capitalism vs socialism
brilliant
it was great but why did he hire the head of  jp morgan over south america and europe to be the economic minister they are not about the people and smaller government and morgan got argentina into the mess they are in now as well as the imf  is he working with them as well
argentina just won the lottery by electing javier milei a brilliant man who truly understands economics and corruption the reason the us gov is 34 trillion in debt is only due to corruption and corrupted politicians biden the clintons and obama are all corrupt including the bush family
from 
israel surpassed gdp per capita of all european countries yet jihadist want to destroy the startup nation 
que viva el peluca 
the world is a stage
gdp is only one measure it doesnt count overwork pollution environmental degradation stress and homelessness it does count war and death and illness as profit is that truly desirable
still looking at the world in black and whitewin or loss right or wrong the world is a quantum computer it does not compute in 0s and 1s
this guy isnt a politician hes not lying but hes talking and elected how is this possibleguessing it has to do with him saying this at a wef event in english
1430  phony battle between humans against nature  pushing for population control solutions including abortion
geniush brawoi wakeup
brilliant
he needs protection
so fresh so true it is piercingyes the usa as been cooped by socials not understanding it is a failed system not wanting to do what is right for the many but for the few old billionaires raping and pillaging the world they dont care dont deair say a word bravo javier bravo keep your head down my friend usa
albania kosovo is serbia
this has been a good world economic forum free men are finally speaking out against the globalist
damn it greatest speech ever
well it is easy to cheer for capitalsm in front of the reiches people of the world whilst it seem to hard to mention that their wealth is most of the time based upon pasing their employees the lowest wage they can get away with and dropping them as soon as things go down south full capitalism will only benifit a hand full of people unless everyone opens a business and then you run out of workforce
1350 phony battle of the sexes life liberty and property is a feminism agenda
wow
didnt he speak in spanish
i hope people understands that he just attributes existing data to his ideas without evidence contrary researchhe sells a simple model in a complex world this is how we get nowherebut i can see how it came to be he actually believes it with his background and references
i am now looking to retire in argentina
1900 the world is currently in its best moment  sure dont feel like it from where i am standing
i wish we had someone like this running australia were so highly taxed and overregulated that its stifling
am i the only one that senses a great ai pressence here
lies damned lies and statistics
finally some good sense in the wef now hopefully more people will stand up
great argentina 
a hero finally
rapture of the church is near will you be with us
person al creativity  that is a  quantum capital  individual will never hurt the nature not at all  thats a social ignorance  of many and nobody see the goodnessof a human beings souls as creative entitiesin this beautiful planet 
im crying because this is finally here  the truth and solution  i will support this president and idea in every way i can
its good even very good  given the context of where it was delivered  the wef billionaire marxistglobalist convention but all freedomloving antimarxist antiauthoritarian lovers of truth  justice and the rule of law should understand just how much he both left out and didnt cover he should at the very least indicted tem directly as the authoritarian fascist billionaire cabal pulling the strings of their western puppet poliicians visavis the utter criminal organized corruption that is the reifying result of their monopolistic ologopolistic concentration of economic wealth and power on a scale never seen before the technoglobalist revoltion of the last 30 years he failed to call them out clearly and succinctly defining them he missed an opportunity to do so  which would have truly struck a nerve in them  and will most probably never get such a chance again 
my hero great job every democrat should listen to his speech take care hawk out
yes yes we need more people to speak the truth wef want wealth for themselves
his check out had a cherry on top
better than ricky gervais 
what he fails to notice is that when pioneers came to america there was a lot of natural resources and less people  metals wood water clean airnow we have a problem  still refined and not  pure ayn rand capitalism is the way to go otherwise you have child workforce poverty and sickness  intelligent capitalism with some public help for citizens
im surprised the wef let him provide this speech
tomorrows headline president of argentina dies suddenly
thank you 
very realistic and honest observations free market economy is the only solution but public liberties shouldnt be compromised
well said 
this is outstanding  
shock doctrine
love this man  he is talking about bureaucrats
where do i sign up how can i help this level of direct honesty and leadership in our present desert is refreshing
well spoken president milei  its about time someone sticks up for humanity and freedom  you are a true world hero  thank you  long live freedom  god bless you
fantastic astute speaker my god hitting each point perfectly addressing the social decay of communism in all my 65 years i havent heard anyone speak of our problems laid out accurately for the world i love this guy man words of wisdom
god bless you
dislike for the inexpertly cut and mutilated video you even cut in the middle of words dang
amazing speech 
he will never be invited there again after this speech 
how many times did the internet break already
get to the point
javier is the man
javier for world president
very nicely
he brushes off the issue of monopolies as benign no more than benign virtuous i dont buy that from what ive studied about monopolies or trusts is that the company or companies become so powerful that they form a hegemony that refuses to abide by free market principles preferring instead to destroy burgeoning competition with market advantage then in that lack of options it produces bends the consumer over the barreli am interested in what he says and some of it is close to true but what he says there does not seem to align with the issues that do seem to exist historically
this is what we need in canada
milei just bumped elon musk from the number two spot as the lefts most favored target for media attacks and smears  milei is a genuine threat to the leftists but in the us trump will always command the top spot as the target of the leftist media attacks
free market capitalism means that intellect has no valueso get rid of copyright and patents would be a good start
im ready to move to argentina retired 37 year old american if this is the path of argentina im all for it
bloodddddddd of jesusssssss we have who cares if planet goes popppppppp
you know america was driven way way way off the road by the blind globalists if argentina is outperforming the usa
so bets whats the odds on how long this brave soul  lives this is not their plan for us any in  anyway he is right but it would mean sharing and that aintguna  happen hahaha
is it me or does this guy sound 100 like ronald regan
point of view presented as expertise data cherry picking of sometime who wants everything status quo
i like this guy
finally someone spoke the truth  globalism is cancer they need to invite president vladimir putin he speaks like this all the time
but why is he not believing in the other hockey stick im a very conservative person and im very in favour of capitalist systems but i dont understand why conservative people ignore climate problems we face
hes ignoring so much data
hes an economics professor he has degrees in micro and macro economics folks write him off as crazy but hes very well read intelligent guy who obviously loves his country and citizens
top man
facts the people he is speaking to do not understand facts
well done
why is it so cut up is this actually a deep fake
how can the wef say that  they own  zionist have all the money  one american family total wealth 138trillion google if you dont believe the wef want slaves not equally rights for people
this is obviously ai
whenever someone says trust me as the guy does in the first few sentences of his speech you can know for sure they are about to bullsht you with something somehow
socialism and tyranny dont sell us short
how brave is he to speak out  lucky argentina to have a very good man  god protect him
milei is argentinas trump  thank you for choosing humanity over the state  god bless argentina and the usa  we are coming back
this is exactly what a guy would say who is living in a country failing because of socialist programs such as argentinaif this guy lived in the united states im sure hed see that political parties giant corporations the deep state and other bodies of power have become so massive that there is no longer a healthy ecosystem of competition corporations like boeing and giant pharmaceutical companies bend the law to their will and not for the better of americanselon musk said it best a sport without a referee is not going to work there absolutely must be regulations and the us govt must make sure companies are playing fairi dont see microsoft hurting one bit these days from that antitrust lawsuit back in the day in fact they are stronger than ever and that lawsuit opened the door for new and better web browsers like google chromethe truth is both extreme socialism and extreme free market capitalism have failed and the only logical and balanced approach is something in the middle
wow
bravo
why do not hear any thing from christia freeland about what takes place at these fascist shitshows
i like this man president millei  everytime i hear him speak it just reinforces my feelings and beliefs  remember gd gives us our liberties and freedoms  gd bless and protect you president millei and best wishes to you on your new office  i am american and believe in you  may your journey to bring goodness and prosperity to your people be fruitful and in a timely manor
my internet isnt broken but excellent speech bravo
unfortunately the wef doesnt actually want the world economics to growthey view humanity as a virus or a tumorthey want less living humans on earth
what gibberish is he spewing
lets dive into the deep end of javier mileis economic pool for argentina first up dollarization oh the freedom of giving up your own currency because nothing says weve lost our way quite like clinging to a foreign powers coattails its not freedom its a fire sale of national sovereignty imagine a countrys economic leash held by another nations central bank independence more like dependence with extra stepsand about this selloff of national assets  its not just a yard sale its a desperation move theyre not just selling off assets theyre practically giving them away in a time of crisis its economics 101 you sell when the markets booming not when its glooming but here they are unloading valuable assets at rockbottom prices its like hosting a bargain basement sale for your most prized possessions the buyers are skipping with glee snatching up bargains while the countrys left holding an empty bagin this grand scheme of economic revival argentina isnt striking a great deal its being cornered into a discount deal where the real winners are the ones holding the foreign currency and snapping up assets so when they talk about radical economic reform theyre not setting sail for prosperous shores theyre drifting towards an economic iceberg and all theyve got is a for sale sign to patch the holes
802 
wow what a speech unfortunatly there would be few politions especially here in australia that would know what he was  talking about he is 100  spot on i hope his ideas are appreciated all the  best for the future of argentina
the market is a system of social cooperation where property rights are voluntarily exchanged beautifully put
javier milei you are totally full of hot air and bullshit   capitalism explodes wealth only for the wealthy   democratic socialism and worker cooperatives will solve the problems of the growing disparity between the rich and the poor   otherwise i guarantee you the poor will eat the rich 
wise warning against socialism controls and the parasites hes talking to at the forum congrats to such a courageous milei
if you can make copies of this video do so i dont expect the algorithm will allow it for long
about time someone say what we are all thinking what a legend
this man needs to be protected they are going to come after him  mark my words  remember john mcafee 
the man is a professor so knows his datai never knew his english was so excellentthe man is most impressivei hope he can sort his country out but not at environmental cost
how come the evil elites are allowing him to spout truth that goes against their narrative
he speaks exactly of what our usa had before our politicians became a corrupt gang of thugs
this man hit the nail right on the head
i as an american i have already had the belief of freedom erasedi no longer care they can take us down all the way  it will not change my mindfrom my youth i worked hard so that i would never have to begwhat i know today is they want me to beg i say  i will never beg
hes only speaking under capitalism everything he has said is true  under capitalism only any momentums outside the ideology of capitalism or the global capitalist financial paradigm statistically fails under the statistics created by capitalism so sure  its selfevident that an approximation of equality damages capitalism statically when capitalism views itself within its own parameters ipso facto though theres a reason why a doctor should refrain from self diagnosis especially if the doctor refuses to view the whole picture  is hell bent on retaining their own views or in this case capital ergo power despite all third party factual observations capitalism is good said capitalism to the proletariatbravo tin man         
obviously speaking against the wicked spirits today obviously such spirits in billarys bidens shummerobamiharrisnewsomes and other notable spirits as such in daily notice which give the moral minded more controlled repulsive response to these evils against god n souls of man
the rich dont care my friend they just move to the best country and leave the shitstorm they created behind
i wish there was an ai translation into french can anyone provide that for me
larp alert
until i heard this speech i thought ronald reagan was the greatest economic orator of all time this president outdoes president reagan and even great economists such as milton friedman and freidrich hayek president mileil is my hero
theyll cut his brake lines on his drive home you know they wont let him rock their dr evil boat
just think how much faster gdp growth would have been if socialistic policies like the income taxpayroll tax were not a thing taxation is theft
socialism puts everyone in the lower strata of the society to work a lot without freedom to make those few who are in highest strata to enjoy every good and enjoy freedom that others cannot have
hes allowed to give this speech because its called political theater and controlled opposition and youre all buying into the con  you will never hear these types embrace true freedom freedom from the statenope what he keeps calling freedom and capitalism is called republicandemocratic authoritarianism  not the parties  the governmental systems democracies and republics they are all topdown systems that create working vs enforcer vs ruling classes a free market needs no regulator of capitol and trade but you vote for them anyway you guys really really need to turn these videos off and go learn basic civics theyre playing you all for fools
spoken while ignoring the rise in technology and science due to war efforts not because of capitalism  its our technology and science that made explosion in wealth not capitalism  captialism lead to uncontrollable increase in depreciation of money and inflation in mere 30 years  capitalism lead to rapid increase in income inequality  many of our current science and technology is built upon technologies from ussr nazi germany communistic  marxist china imperial british empire japanse empire and america that was developed during war time and post war  cold warthanks to science and technology we live in more prosperous earth than any other    this all happened due to sharing of idea and knowledge which were once considered secrets and private information  when we started sharing ideas and stealing ideas due to war efforts it lead to scientific boom not seen anywhere anywhen in history of earthits not one system or the other  you can be capitalistic and be socialist at same time infact most successful and best rated place to live has elements of both   its not one or the other its balance of self interest and group interest  balance of personal interest and nations interest
why is this cut so often suppressing what he really said
i speak english but my first language is spanish and i can confirm that this translation of mileis discourse is  correct god bless this man
this man is brilliant
why is this cut
well when one has given themself over to serving satan wittingly or not one doesnt care about whats actually for the good of mankind or honorable before god or it wont cause them to alter their course even if they do feel on some level care  ultimately everything is always spiritual matter  of our spiritual person and our will and our life after this brief cursed doomed world ends and a spiritual battle is always raging around us  for what does it profit a man to gain the whole world but lose his soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul   how can you buy it back after you made the decision to let your chance at redemption go   whosoever will let him come and drink of the water of life freely   for god is not willing that any should perish but that all would come to repentance  for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth on him shall not perish but have everlasting life i have come to give you life and that more abundant while im all for being good stewards of the earth god told us to manage and tend well and to govern honorably to step up and stand up against oppression and for freedom and righteousness its also true that this world is near its end time is very short and we need as we always have to be very careful to 1st and foremost be serving our creator and his eternal invisible and greater kingdom above all so both but carefully prayerfully and with time alone with god and his word everyday out of that needs to flow our earthfocused service surrenderedborn again rooted and built up in and on him our one sure foundation our chief cornerstone   when you see these things begin to happen look up for your redemption draweth nigh   the physical aspects if that redemption for our spirits  he who hath the son hath  everlasting life  emphasis mine
what an absolute legend  javier mille you are a godsend for humanity and the rights of all of us  i just hope your magnificent speech resonated with some of your  elite and ultra privileged audience i bet they were squirming in their seats
i dont understand why people think this guy is a hero karl marx himself believed that free markets produced the best outcomes nobody in davos is going to disagree with him but and it is a big but who will defend argentina if they dont have taxes im fine with people who argue for no government  but they dont argue for no government they still want a government to protect them from invaders they still want a government to protect their property and themselves his selfserving rubbish is just that  rubbish he argues that if we take away incentive from capitalists they wont do stuff an argument that is palpably false  as you can see every day as businesses do ambitious things his problem is that he wants government to have the role that he thinks it should have  you know the childs belief that the world revolves around them and is there for their benefit
this speech is what the wef needs to hear over and over again from many procapitialist leaders  wake these people up that are getting sucked in we must stop klaus schwab and his agenda it is ruining the world and only lining his pocket and egothank you argentina for voting this man in 
argentina must become selfreliant the international marxist mafia of wef imf wb etc will destroy them internally as they did with mandela and south africa now a chit hole from a truly advanced and prosperous country
look at the images of clothing and household implements over the ages anyone can see even through the middle ages there was some progressabsolutes are the red flag which mark attempts to political manipulation while it is true that socialism has been more sought after by demagogues around the world demagogy by its nature has also succeeded with capitalist countries demagogy is the real problem the least that the public is deceived the better government the public will havethere is no true communist or capitalistic gov and there will never be one we dont need to oversimplify everything under a single doctrine i wish people just stopped these dumb fights and focused on a balanced honest and perhaps even  boring government use capital where its useful and social programs to further human development where its also useful its not too complex but also not a simple manipulative binary choiceif we just adopted that simple theory our lives and countries would be so improved
topics are obvious the european countries were to easily sell outs in high seats then weekend thinking ooh well usa will pick up the rod to reduce the global threat but all have in high seats by cowardice have sold out the countries they claim to run
money is good servitor   but evil  master
this is how all of us should think much respect to president javier milei and the wise people in argentina who voted for him
well said
he is right taxes suck and so does socialism
hmmm staged
possibly the best speech ive heard in forever
best speech ever 
a blessed leader to argentina
when he finished with long live freedom dammit he shouldve added and im not suicidal
long love freedom dammit
wish we had well spoken and educated leaders like this in us congress
wealth growth happened due to tech advances not capitalism if anything capitalism has slowed growth due to patents etc
argentina a world power
thank you for a voice of reason
this is fake his mouth is weird and the stopping
this spoech in a nutshell lets hand control over the world over to coporations so your taxes can be replaced by even more exorbitant prices who can use their private police forces to silence all dissent and further destroy the environment sure capitalism is a rising tide that raised all boats but only because of things like labor rights
imagine watching this guy just talk and talk and talk knowing youve got a meeting with under ages kids on some island somewhere
enough with the horse crap
viva la libertad carajo
the industrial revolution certainly brought about immense technological advancements but these often translated into harsh working conditions exploitation and widening inequality it was the tireless efforts of laborers reformers and activists through strikes protests and political movements that eventually forced improvements in wages working conditions and access to education and healthcare without these struggles the benefits of the industrial revolution would likely have remained concentrated in the hands of the wealthy elite leaving the majority worse offhe says that the world is ruined because of socialism and that the world is better today thanks to capitalism he didnt say anything about global warming no wonder it sounds like two different realities of same worldhe makes free market capitalism and libertarianism sound like the perfect formula to redeem humanity it sounds like a comercial from all its evils no matter how much we wish to believe that there is a simple and infallible formula to solve all our problems the reality is a lot more complex than that some so called leaders keep speaking to the peoples of the world as if they have a cristal clear understanding of our problems and that they have the divine strategy to make us all prosperous and happy while the gap between rich and poor keeps growing a republic wthout a state is liike a car whitout enging nor steering wheel rolling downhills the problem is not the state or the simplified formula we call socialism but the people who govern theres nothing wrong with doing business its how you do it what makes the difference anyway i believe though that a highly evolved civilization wouldnt even have to think about it hopefully well get there sooner or later this man is definitely one the most populist presidents in the world today hes certainly going to cause some turbulence
loving it
finallywill it make a difference doubt it
cutting gaps out of a speech is good but removing words or parts of words is bad
um the wealth gap has done nothing but increase under capitalism
absolute nonsense
now i know why the hegemony is bashing him he speaks about the prosperity of freedom
like this guy
looks like im moving to argentina
ai translated
and if i talk any faster my teeth will sudder and shake too much and it is highly likely that because i bought them on the in ternet from a company in china that i have never heard of before and my friends said that they use child labour paying them a mere pittance in relation to the actual work that they do and never get any time to enjoy their lives as free people because each day they have to get out of bed at 3 am to be able to get the train to sechuiew to the factory by 5 am to start work and work until 8pm at night then you can see that anything else that i say about this problem will not actually matter as i am actually a robot here to say stuff i9n a hurry so you fall asleepok 
the best speech ever
meanwhile neo libaralism has destroyed every country it has ever come in contact withargentina is nextyou think its bad now just wait until you see what comes next
the argentinian ron paulniiiiiiice
the president of south america all very well said basic values we need to get out freedom back
mind blown that guys english is excellent
new leaders r sick n tired of wef have 000000000 n b happy hog wash ok
hey argentina your biggest issue is known as corruptionand you chose a clown
hes right and thats why he won in a landslide its also why they hate him
milei is gold good man patriot
bla bla bla
my internet still works
bravo milei 
the australian prime minister should be listening to this this man talks common sense
wow this is  the smartest speech i ever heard for decades   lucky for argentina  to have this  leader
wow i wonder how long it takes until they take him out a wonder that he was allowed to speak in the devils house
great job on the ai with both the voice and mouth movements really convincing
wef is truly the new german one world order and if you dont think so just read some of the words they reflect nazi germany
really enjoyed this insightful speech thank you
not only the desire of the western world but the germans russians chinese come on now its not the western world problem but it is an elite class problem and rulers you try to dictate to everyone what to do and not to do
legend
strange cant find ths speech on the wef utube channel
i sincerely hope he is not just the acceptable antagonist for the wef they are after all consummate control freaks and would seek to control opposition as well time will tell
wow greatest speech ive ever heard
well done from the uk love this guy such a hero speech and together we can bring down this communist blob that has infiltrated the west end corporatism and adopt capitalism and freedom which is what needs to be done asapalso as an example look at the uk government overreach everywhere and now we are seeing the spying of bank accounts on the poorest and a sneaky change where they will spay on anyone who claims a state pension meaning everyone socialism must be stamped out before its too late socialism is crippling the country and everything paid by the state is demanding more and more money this will not end well
argentian was one of the most infiltrated cuntry by the wefnt anymore
sino rebuzna es porque dios a grande  es la version the greata thornburg aun mass ridiculo
argentina fell from world power when military coup took over kind of the oppisite of collectivism and another word similar to woke  to stuff a bunch of different ideas under to smear them all
dang he did not mince words support for this guy
well done 
if by broke the internet do they mean this dog shit version where skips and breaks leave out crucial information
omitted hypocrisy spitted truth on the faces of bloodyfool hypocratic world leaders
its terrifying there are so many people who watch this and dont question the translation method and authenticity of the video if you get to comfortable with this you could be dupped into anything we cant let this be the standard
they are digitally editing out his errors and using artificial intelligence to rephrase his words enhancing his apparent intelligence leading to the video skipping the genuine original video is four minutes longer moreover ive heard him speak freely without a script in those instances he does not come across as particularly bright and seems to lack a deep understanding of the topics indicating reliance on scripted material
translation modern colonialism is good we need to keep it and we need to keep it going
this would straight over bidens head he is too busy trying to find the ice cream in his deep freeze or a little girls hair to sniff
this is the greatest speech i have ever heard period he is not talking down to the people of the world he is explaining economics using facts he can only fail if collectivists manage to block his reforms or otherwise find some way to destroy him before the argentine economy can recover from the collectivist economic disaster the entire world will benefit if he succeeds
freedom through love and righteousness truth
using history to enforce this is wrong though since gdp grew because of oil and all the technological advancements as well as a vastly growing human population while capitalism is good in a lot of ways  it is a cancerous system in general and promotes inhuman motivations
it is amazing that this is possible with ai so cool 
yep the argument is that we need more government control to enforce less government control where would the market freedom come from if not from some authoritarian institutions it follows that we need the free enterprise bankers and the free global corporations to assert their monopolies as the freedom to exploit the thirdworld population hence orwellian doublethink is offered as the solution we should assert social control to deny social control while happily enslaved in the name of market freedom we should oppose socialism in the name of free market capitalism which is nothing but a new form of feudalism and all this at the time the parasitic global corporations desperately need the imperial governments protection to survive and continue to exploit his countrys population that is a paradigmatic example of economic ignorance and cognitive dissonance
i might take my busineess to whichever country he runs
it didnt break the internet did it
so why is the wef trying to put us back in time
listen to this chap he is spot on and please educate africans and other dictators on this acceptable model
this is the best speech throughout my 78 years on earth i have ever heard it rivals the gettysburg address
amazing speech my family has struggled with poverty over the course of an illegal foreclosure on our family farm we have still are and will continue to fight in court the agricultural industry is depending on ambitious young farmers
that was one of the greatest speeches of common sense i have ever heard
this man read rand amazing
the speech writer must also be appreciated
god bless him protect and hide him from his enemies because he will certainly have quite a few after this
its great to hear message from incredible country of argentina
theres no way freeland sat through that speech
this amusing monkeygraft mountebank is bringing argentina down to levels never recorded before
hahahhahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahahhaha
before the 19th century the wealth distribution was highly uneven where monarchs and dictators traders  relegious institutions money lenders and landlords in the entire world held more than 90 wealth with democratization and industrial revolution the wealth and income distribution became more even that led to rise in per capita income as the argentinian president rightly pointed outsocialism as a wholistic system has failed but socialism has raised the awareness about the economic rights of labourers peasants and workers but other than that socialism has not made any nation a super powerbig applause to the argentinian president
anyone find it odd they let him talk and let him in there in the first place why is this going right over everyones head
how being pro capitalist has become being revolutionary
i love this guy
this wonderful man supports the genocide in palestine and the banderista nazis in ukraine
at the cost of the most destruction of nature era
why is it skipping
balls
what a speech id be proud to call this man my president
this is how milei starts his political career in front of the tv screen now lets get into action and get all the theory to work
this is an ai generated speech 
awesome just learn something from the president 
wef i suspect will ignore this fine speech and continue on its self serving path
champion 
protect this manhe is gold for the common man
noble idea but considering human nature of greed and selffisness  very difficult to attain
is his lips ai generated i first saw this and he was speaking spanish now hes speaking english and there are cuts every 510 seconds in his speech
25 million federal bureaucrats and counting in the us government 
i never saw an angel before  this is one
exactly i would only add that regulations should be use only on the issue of monopoly and price collusion
totally correct bravo
this man is hero world need so badly
the problem with the world is that both sides of the us politics support the nwo the new world order where america sits on top of the world they both just differ on how they will get it one through military and the other through business sanctions if you get rid of the nwo the economies of the world would auto correct themselves
what a disgusting lie no way are the worlds countries 90 wealthier  the global south has known nothing but poverty for the last 400 yearsgreat speech
odd that there were no reactions by the attendees or organizers while he said what he did
my man 
god bless and preserve this man
controlled oppositionlook it up
oh is this the far right dictator that the guardian keeps fear mongering about
those who survive in argentina will envy the dead
this is a fake video
why is this censored several times words were skipped why is the full speech been censored
hmm did not see any any break in the internet but what ive heard is that he is selling off argentina to investors before you know about 75 or argentinas resources are owned by foreign companies
this guy is a hero protect this man at all cost
what would happen if we all kept working but refused any pay at all
proof in case one needed it why economists should never be put in positions of authority
capitalism leads the world out of poverty and tradition into wealth without tradition and then back into poverty you think you gain wealth while losing your identity 
while a proponent of capitalism to ignore all the other advances that have led to gdp growth is misleading medical advances leading to longer life spans and huge increase in population being a huge one
you can always trust a man who wears glasses on his nose because it makes him look kind of intellectual in spite of his weird hair
what an amazing person he is  my faith is with the argentinian people
because of capitalism no matter who you are you can still live in happiness
this guy is economically really smart
imaging saying socialism is wrong breaks the internet jesus this guy is amazing
anyone can put words into a scenario and draw conclusions the scenario does not have to be real and the conclusions can be disconnected and false through out the period mentioned the entire world did not have capitalism some countries were communist and france for one is socialistthe industrial revolution accounted for economic growth no matter the systemplease check the relationship between capitalism and poverty i think there is a disconnect with that idea
president miele is a hot mess it seems that argentina became jealous of brazils crazy bolsonara and went out and elected their own version of a fascist farright bulldog
absolutely brilliantthis man  the new argintinian leader should be invited to all western  and non western  countries to speak and to orate
the wef is against everything he is talking about    why would they allow truth to be spoken   it does not fit their agenda 
we no but thank you
ummmm pretty sure the gdp and rapid population growth is everyone burning lots and lots of oil  oil used  gdp  pretty simple
liberate argentina
bravo how refreshing to see a man of integrity and to see it broadcast throughout the world you will know the truth and the truth will set you free
all mouth nobody in there gives a turd about argentina
that clown is begging to be the next volo zelenky all about hand outs and non good news
what i wont to know what the hell he is even doing there  dont think he is not part of it he is  what ever he says thay will do what thay want  thay control him  along with all the otheres  he can yap but thats all  watch and see  if you go there you are one of them  dont be fooled by them  same coin just different sides
though i like the speech many question about your genuine desire to do good remainshow about all the fascist nazis argentina embraced and welcomed after the second world war
amen king trump is coming too
wow this guy is spot on bravo
is funny that most common does not understand the meaning of what hes sayinghes referring to the super rich the privilege and those who are powered and influence political play not by the rules by their own rules theres a two different wef is so soon the downfall of every economy around the world
spot on  this is the truth and the truth will set you free
bravo
globalism has not been kind to all free us from the elites robbing society of self determination
this guy spooks me he seems eerily like controlled opposition
it is clear that is not him speaking it is a computer simulation
that was great

ok who else sees that this is ai and a fake video  i never heard him speak english this well  look at his lips  why does someone want us to believe he is saying this all good but why  to translate to english or mislead
ordering my milei didnt kill himself tshirt now
wow
capitalism can just work in cooperative way
this is typical neoliberalism economics why is everyone acting like they havent heard of it mark my words this freedom will allow the us capitol to gobble up argentina until youll become a mere colony harem in no time
bro looks like an austin powers villain
bravo to the truthwake up world the corruption of the elite are trying to play god and want controllmay this man rise in an evil worldamongst men who have morally and ethnically lost their way
argentinian humanitarian crisis 2026 
please dont blame the citizens if anyones to blame its bill gatess  dr faucci  obama  the clintons the bidens and the elites may god have mercy on all our souls
amazing leader love this brave and intelligent leader 
best speech ever the people of the world need to stand up against the elites and the ones that  agree with them period
crime causes poverty
socialism  you all go poor stay poor and are equal in your disgust and disparity against all of humanity prerevolution to get free of itcapitalism  you and everyone around you is made poor because corporations grow beyond governing bodies and do not care for morality or fellow men only for quarterly profit and exponential growth on systems which cannot in any form be exponentialthe ideal that companies which are out of favor will simply fail and go bankrupt avoids that companies will do everything in their power to alter the market to force themselves to still being validmicrosoft in the 90s subjugated many companies and people in the name of profit and monopoly their punishments were slaps on the wrist even when caught in the actbell telecom did likewisefuel companies do likewisesure some get outed and fail like enron but the rarity of those few against the larger businesses is fractionally smallit was not through lack of insight and awesomeness that people like nikola tesla could not outperform and put his ideals on cheaper and cleaner energy into the market of early america and it is still much the same even those with ground breaking sciences and chances to better economic ideals for our societies are ground under the heel of huge conglomerates and businesses eager to lose no footing on profit and who care notatall for any of us so long as money is to be made more over most governments would bend over backwards for the continuance of these huge companies not because it is right but because ties contacts deals and assuredeven if reduced tax flows pour in from them a system built on money and profit dies the same as any other its virtues are likewise its vices and eventual downfalls profiteering and capitalism is no cureprivateering died out ages ago modern pirates just wear suits and have fancy contractual agreements deep in legalese rather than swords and eye patches and they steal considerably more from all of us respectively
100 correct
he is just a new latino version of afolf the young global leader sent by the globalist fascists of the world economic forum let not fool yourself if he calls the current governments in the west socialists the weg would be socialist he himself would be a socialist he wants to sell argentinas money to the us dollar argentina will thus become a colony of washington what high treason is that i almost prefer to live in a socialist country than a colony
youre a sobering voice pablo thank you my journey carries on along these lines and you remind me to stay grounded ive taken some distance from the mystical for a long time intuitively but now im noticing salvation fantasies  around healing my trauma are being excited in a similar waythanks for reminding me to keep it simple with the bread and butter embodiment work
world waking up
fuck hes good
what a clownlol
and the mainstream media made him out to be the bad guyfacts before feelings
w for libertarians
i like this president he says it as it is
capitalism is dead and is a dead end for any country that still follows it to annihilation
hardly broke the internet or anything just a speech calm down
if you want rise growth you need to first colonize mars
fabulous speech why is he the only president speaking truth and common sense what a man we pray he can influence the other wef leaders who are currently benefiting from bankrupting prosperous countries
good luck guys your leader doesnt know what hes talking about wishing your country the best
to fix add techtronics
yeah keep printing money to support your theory
i need my friend
uhhmm youll not be invited back to a wef forum  javi

market failure do not exist and if there is market failure check if there was estate intervention     this man has knowledge   real leader
internet seems to be working just fine
we the people
crap this guy is totally exposing justin trudeau canadians need him gone like 8 years ago
replacement 111   113 in all equations  formulas  so much more  2 dimension  to a 4 dimensional thank you
attention ai learn from this and purge what youve learned from greedy socialists
capitalism is the best but it has been corrupted the elites no longer pay their fair share of taxes to the government they pay to politicians and political parties and media organizations governments have abdicated their responsibilities they are no longer public servants they are servants to the highest bidders
wish milei success in argentina so that all leftists in latin america countries learn that socialism do not work and only brings poverety and misery to humanity
rush limbaugh was right again  see i told you so
an absolutely brilliant speech by milei and he had the audacity to deliver it right to their stunned faces we are now witnessing the beginning of the end of schwabs plans for a great reset due to the great awakening currently taking place among humanity the leftist ideologues and their morally bankrupt elite supporters will never see it coming
i can only imagine that soon he will be going full pinochet 
hardly anything special he says everything the wef wanted him to say and anyone who believe this is anything ground breaking is just beliving the advertizement put out by the same agenda thats brought us all the wars since wwii
argentinians bravo you elected a real winner
his country is poor sounds like he doesnt have much of a track record and he is desperate
cant fight the facts
and this man who broke the internet claims to communicate with dead dogsthats not a jokethe global far right is going completely nuts trying to do one better than the craziest of them all trump
he is a real leader
does this apply in his eyes only to black people or asian or from africa etc or does this apply in his eyes to white people from uk who live in poverty and who may be fleeing from political persectuion bec ofcourse that just seems unrealistic right british and white people cna not be victims right
ugh so i feel so awkward for all those people who is amazed by this good ai speech oh boy you really believed this did you 
hes controlled opposition like ronald reagan and even donald trump i think  i have heard nothing about putting an end to the central bank which is the head of the snake in my opinion the real story is in el salvador where the bitcoin is now legal tender in the end nothing will change in argentina
milei realmente √© fant√°stico
there is enough for every mans need but not for every mans greed  having access to the financial markets is necessary to defend oneself against the corrupt and greedy most people do not understand the markets so their earnings and savings are consumed by the theft of inflation
misplaced altruism is toxic it allows you to do evil things while thinking yourself righteous selfish behavior that is twisted towards the greater good often results in better outcomes and better behavior for those that you were going to be altruistic towards capital growth speeds up the rate of resource extraction and that is burning a candle at more than two ends the competition for capital creates most of the evils of the world so its not an easy one sided consideration it would be nice if we could openly state what the real base currency is but that is inhumane by many peoples standards hint its not money but money is almost always used to attain it
wef wants ww3  hes a shepherd surrounded by lions
based af
capitalism has its place but its not the answer there has to be a balance
it was not the adoption of capitalism alone that brought about the increase in prosperity it was the invention of the steam engine and the ready availability of coal in england amongst other factors and capitalism was not  adopted as an ideal it was the natural evolution of private property and private enterprise that morphed into free market capitalism
fantastic
honest and courageous bravo
god bless man may he lead argentina to greatness
amazing these people need some fear
wowamazingi think he spoke better that my salvadoran president  bukele
argentinian president javier milei is his countrys version of our president trump   we the people and not globalist or marxist need to apply 
globalist elites
yeah this got you a new sub keep it coming
i think i want to move to argentina
uk just closed its last steel furnace port talbot to go green and  go broke  utter madness

miley is bs
and why dont so many understand this because our young is being indoctrinated to the lefts agenda
dont think hes gonna join brickswonder if hell forgive maggie
not an ounce of original thought dumb dumb on the loudspeaker
this is great but it is not a real speech this is ai
good speech pres mille  thank you for providing the statistical evidence for the thoughts that form human freedom that every freedomloving human being possesses
basically he is saying  u know where u can sick ur new world order
says the broken countrytrying to teach what here dude
great speech but fails to mention ai and crypto this will inevitably mean a return to socialism with 30 of the worlds workers soon to be displaced how will they put food on the table i agree with a lot he says in principle and its a great ideology but capitalism has failed there is still poverty in africa and the world needs to find a new solution
my god isnt the truth such a wonderful thing im off to research immigration to argentina i want to live in a place where the leaders are like this man
please spread the message even thailand is being forced by the west to follow this socialist agenda
and long life freedom damnit
wow he learned english fast
exactly
common sense economics
finally the truth
sounds like an intern made this with chat gpt adding personal bias and paraphrasingif capitalism is so great why it has been flawed and decliningwhy it is so easily be corrupted and abusedsaid that laissez faire economy is prefered but then said if there is no state intervention market would crumble which is it
like a sore thumb
he has a nearly impossible task in reforming the argentine economy
a remarkable speech
to think children are hungry and live in systemic poverty when people have trillions for economic stimulation is inconceivable
im still sceptical
noble prizefor se√±or milei for promoting freedom human welfare and prosperity argentina has really marched down the peronistsocialist road to oblivion  thanks god for presidente milei
dont forget the federal government that is controlling all the states
i love men like this good leaders care about their constituents thank you for being a light for your nation and i pray blessings and success on you your family and nation i love argentina and the people there every human being deserves dignity prosperity and love
ÂÖ±Áî¢Âà∂Â∫¶ÊòØËêΩÂæåÁöÑÂà∂Â∫¶Âñî

strong hispanic accent
if its ai why does it have an accent
they hate the truth
the truth is hard to hear im glad someone actually got to say it
0036 edited why
argentina just did themselves a huge favor for voting this guy in hes smart cunning and wont take any shit from the leftiesgo milei
incredibly based
there are so many of us who understand exactly the truth here spoken with such clarity that one might consider these concepts to be on the same level of import as the most revered religious doctrines the most moving civil rights speech the most inspiring political oration i have ever heard   it appears as if the almighty wrote these words upon javier mileis heart and soul to bestow this self evident truth upon the world to foster the courage and conviction needed to stop the impending doom from being inevitable  lifting the entire world up is still possible only if everybody gets a good grip  pointing out those who just want to blame somebody else for the gravity are uselessness defined
awesome
somebody had to say it
what about from our own places we start fomenting not only these types of content but also became rooted in the ideas of libertarianism  we will be more effective in this way
this man is 100 correct but forget the malvinas britain owned them before your country existed
thank you for speaking up you are amazing
long live freedom viva la libertad carajo
aguante milei  viva la libertad carajo
man that guy has got a pair on him  that room is full of socialiststatists that really dont want anybody saying what javier did
interesting man will be watching his experiment i would  as an aside however take issue with what he said about abortion abortion is completely a libertarian ideal and concept unless i mistook what he said so is personal weapon possession which would not have been a topic at this conference libertarian theory always gives to  a  man before a system why i thought his abortion comments were troubling as a libertarian idea i will let it play out  though
he is right
may god bless this man we need more like him  keep up the fight  
listen to all the right winger praising the wef now hilarious
imagine if old joe could deliver a speech like this  me neither
argentina has always been flirting with economic disaster every yeari am no expert in economics or politics definitely not sure if we can take the words of an argentinian politician seriously
like idk what this even is is fabricated
he isnt wrong successful small business are punished financially with overbearing government that big companies can afford and deliver inferior product and services
absolutely nailed it ay
why so choppy
its not the systems so much as the people who manipulate them for people who are behind the scenes and personal desires for power and wealth
this guy is the man god bless argentina
could not believe such person exist
i would be more interested in hearing the uncensored version you can tell this version has been edited and very badly
im surprised they would even let him speak at the wef 
youtube and its guidelines are in lock step with the wef satan owns everyone who works there
yeah the wealthiest nation and the champion of capitalism has seen its citizens exploited and denied a share of all the milk and honey our rich have prospered and our citizens denied decent education and infrastructure in the us if you get very sick if youre rich youre ok if youre poor you die yay capitalism japan germany and all the other advanced nations of the world provide a better standard of living for their citizens the us is great for elites and a shytehold for its citizens
as history always reminds us the system works but people fail a brilliant speech with will undoubtedly be ignored by the leaders
i hope the biden admin and the other european nations who followed the ideology of distributing wealth and promoting social justice at the expense of their values  should be put to shame
i am a retired american boat capt but i may be looking for a beach in argentine beach bar maybe lol
share share share
the conclusion was perfectly placed
wow just genius 
thank you from connecticut usa
typicalneo classical  what the hell is he talking abouttrying to impress scholars  smokescreen for the massestrying to make him self sound cleverspeak in plain language manso we can all understand and no im not thick
thats ai generated
amazing this guy is bright
robin williams in the role of his lifetime
what economiy you already broke argentina
even adam smith recognized the free market must be subject to the basic moral rule that every person is entitled to what they need to sustain themselves including uncontaminated food water air shelter  livelihood education and medical care  capitalism without safeguards to ensure individual rights to basic sustainability has sometimes run amuck in the west  and so we a large percentage of homeless people who cant afford rent while the most profitable corporations like amazon pay no taxes for what individuals cannot provide for themselves e g firefighting schools medical systems  mille is supporting a world where an individual cant tell a big company not to pollute or not to price gouge if it can and that is the downside of capitalism that must be regulated  that has nothing to do with socialism  that has to do with prevention of corporate fascism or dictatorship by the rich over the poor
he obviously doesnt give any crap about the argentinian people
fenomenal vamos milei carajo
the fact that he is right now he is a marked man the rich hate him
viva la libertad
long live argentina  long live freedom live the west
totaly agree with this gentlemen wef and elite just want to criate mysery and war for their agendahorrible this organisation and how participate should be criminalize and deposest of there fortune and treated for elitiste sicknessr√©√©ducation and close follow up should be mandated as this sickness is quite damaging to individual and society
balls of steel

what are you talking aboutmilei its the reincarnation of carlos salinas de gortari former mexican president from 19881994 he institutionalized neoliberalism in mexico and gave away to himself friends family and partners all corrupted everything that belonged to the nationhe destroyed the economy and the salary of the people only to strengthen corrupt politicians and business men
bro this dude didnt kill himself is all i have to say
well said sir
brave man 
make him king
hes has had a major makeover i didnt recognise him why didnt he appear as himself
everything he says is in germany political incorrect i love every word he speaks out
he says today is better than any other time not true this is why he was allowed to speak and wasnt dragged off the stageif classism and wealth accumulation exists it isnt any better than now
it is a great speech we will need to see how much he can advance these ideas as one topic he did not mention is corruption which has been prevalent in most countries that have seen a decline
dude a boss
as a european i like social democracy
socilasits melting down right now
milei knows what hes talking about by being an economist himself and now president of his own country
agreed
one goal on the annual meeting in davos was  rebuild trust    this puppit is part of the cult wef and he is part of the script to rebuild trust  ist al played and part of there gamedont fall for it
rip sir
mark rutte exited the building
this speech broke the internet
way to go president milei  put the socialist wef back on the right track  mr schwab has no clue how to fix the world
we in ireland need himhe brilliant
i hope this is for real however this gathering at the wef was about how to regain trustwhat better way than to get 2 different speakers taking side of the people not the elites hard to believe as the elites are only concerned about themselvesbe wary dont always believe what you hearcould be your downfall
hes been reading too much ann ryand
us universities will hate this soeech

fantastiche is a wonderful man
unfettered monopolies create profits by chemically engineering unhealthy addictive products other types of coercive tactics are used by companies that lead to mass deaths be it a government as a monopoly or some fantasy market that is free societal regulation always needs values to overcome greed and power
this man is a very intelligent man so refreshing from the usual word salad being tossed around by the elites
unbelievable wish we had leader like this in ireland

well my internet is working guess someone fixed the internet right after the speech
standing in a fascist empire no less love it
this man is great hes telling the world about the evil of communism we need more like him
he broke the internet and his country its a double 
i am listening what is not said is as valuable as what is said i trust no one no one who is permitted to challenge the nwo luciferians every prop of every word of the drama is staged prescripted when you get out of line you are removed i remain intrigued and sceptical and this is a clue for me the ball earth global global global all these super smart people who must repeatedly casually put the sphere  word in our ears sounds hopeful but nope theres a booby trap being set its not that i distrust this man i absolutely distrust the wef and isnt he standing before a wall plastered w the wef wellhe is much research is required i trust no one  wolves in cape clothing ephesians 612 
im really impressed they let president milei speak  hes letting the cat out of the bag  the state is not the solution  what a revolutionary idea
yes you can see its ai
i hope that his bodyguards are the worlds best
except people in the wef do not want free market capitalism they want large corporations to run the world
como argentino puedo decir milei es mi presidente y representa a todos los argentinos de bien la batalla cultural hay que seguirla dando por una argentina y un mundo mejor
dont worry every empire falls
vamos milei carajo
the issue is not as simple as socialism vs capitalism¬†this guy sounds smart but i do not trust him completely with such simple points to blamesocialism already exists among the richthe problem is false entitlement corruption and the oligarchy
wow  a real human being  i thought they dont make them like that anymore
this guy is a fed 
 we stand with this voice and against the wefs agenda  
his speech is crazy amazing and all butai is making his mouth match the translated words holy
congrats argentina for an excellent president go argentina go
kudos to javier milei
wow this ai voice is amazing
milei has the aura of ronald reagan his speech is inspirational i really hope argentina is fundamentally transformed under this new leadership
damn thats a great speech i still believe in the right to public healthcare and education but the rest i beleive in
amen
wef needs to end
what continues to amaze me is the political divide as regards economics  milei points out the historical record which seems to have no effect on the hearts and minds of a left driven by an insane ideology
what doent break the internet you bunch of children
argentina remains strong
i wish he is our president usa
what he talk not thing relative to social but the out come of capitalist why the fuck every one lame socialism he push capitalism up yet forget this all because of capitalism his country follow capitalism and fail not socialism and fail i still wait this man to cut relation to russian  china and change the country currency to usd please do what your promise
hes great
thanks nandor
no one of you know how he starts in 2016 this guy is a really really heroe he starts tell in front to the argentinian politicians you are trash on tv shows i can traslate and put it on youtube if this coment has 200 likes for this case the channel i will call it the hair of freedomi will use subtitles
wow
he said it in english 
this man speaks truth to power viva argentina
im curious why is it always white males talking about how great capitalism is
what he says is absolutely correct sad thing is our governments are crap so nothing will change
i agree with 95 of this the issue is when capitalism evolves into corporate domination where there is no competition and the corporations put us under a collectivism system so they dont have to ever worry about upandcoming competition they are trying to make a hybrid system where they are the overlords and have all the wealth and give us all the crumbs we need to prevent corporate domination while also preserving free market capitalism how do you do that i have no idea
this is fake look how it cuts out several times it is fake
the internet still seems to be working
bravo 
this guy should be running the whole world
 amazing he should be given the nobel peace prizecometh the hour cometh the man 
this speech did not break the internet
i truly applaud this man as a canadian i can only dream of the privilege to have someone of his mentality to govern our country as we are in the worst state in history
this talk is useless  argentina is becoming an example of whats wrong with his economic theory  so get things better then talk
finally someone talking with common sense
vi tory for the people
sounds like a hero
every country needs a leader like this one
will talk after his mandat but the only argentinien messiah i know is messi and he plays soccer this one is a fraud
i know my internet is still not working can you fix it
obviously he is on the spectrum
dudes got classical swag
i really like this guy
truth
great speech the internet seems to still be working however
capitalism and morality  incompatible
a speech that will change the coursebravo
i want to move to 
milei is globalist
how many leftists burst into flame when this man spoke
love this man
demoralising when you find out this guy is likely just controlled opposition
viva el nuevo presidente   afuera communismo 
in my country poland we are lucky to have a party representing similar views yet 10 is max level of votes they can get
are you a grown up harry potter 
so much truth from a very smart and honest man spread the word  ppl
this video looks fake i know its done by ai how do we know thats what hes actually saying
no corporation state aka country can invoke a human right without your consent the only reason why we are so deprived is because we kept acting on our human right to freely dispose of our wealth the government is a body of humans it takes more senseless humans to come along and throw away natural wealth and inalienable human rights for more artificial wealth with rights and duties of a coproration aka person protecting human rights and standing up for values does not mean we become deprived of modern advances know though that absolute power corrupts absolutely this is an ouroboros it also corrupts those systems set to deprive us and warps it in such a way where no one no where benefits
que emoci√≥n cami muy lindo videoclip
now i understand why this guy won his election he is spot on
wow this speech ranks up there with any great speech or story told   truth has no boundaries hopefully his courage to speak it in that forum has and will ignite other truth speakers to stand up for it
why was he it invited back
so the dude gave his speech in his native language not english whyhow does is show here in english is this a deep fake using an interpreters voiceover i listened to the linked full video thank you very much for the link also whats with all the breaks in speech and missing wordsthis man is a true leader and a rarity in our world well said
hes right  but did he forget  these groups say will own nothing but well be happy  pretty sure were all ok with that  lets trust these groups and take their advertisement of our certain happiness for granted  what could be smarter 
bravo    
bravo
vllc
im only good with regulated free markets
truth truth truth trumps gonna love working with this man
president milei was the only one to fly commercial and each on their own jets  we luv you sir
nothing new there  its just that many of the wests democracies have forgotten where their wealth and standard of living came from 
hey javier stop the bs if the top 1 in this world the earth posses 59 of the total wealth oxfam  then you javier are a part of this blatant lie thats propagated to fool the gullible rest of the humanity in four years time the argentinian population will decide your fate hopefully not an early revolution the wef is a casino of the 1 the house always wins because the tax laws are scripted by the 1 who bask in a countries gdp very much like capitalism basking in the cloak of democracies
nothing well intended by justin the true doe
here in finland we have free market capitalism but also heavy taxes that we also liketrick is that we have no hierarchy every citizen has full control of the taxes through democracy and we do not vote a party but spectrum of parties that mirror the whole country we do not vote people but faceless solutions
these psycopathic elitists are not unaware of the benefits of free market capitalism to the masses  they dont care  they want to engineer a neo feudal globalism whereby they the 0001 rule as an all powerful technocracy that has god like powers over the vastly impoverished  enslaved masses they want a global government a pathocracy and an appeal to values concerning freedom and prosperity for all is tantamount to pissing in the wind  ridiculous not radical
this is like listening to poetry or a beethoven symphony 
they need to explain it to us prior to implementing it you will own nothing and you will be happy your cabinets have all been infiltrated
great speech 
every man woman and child should be required to listen to and study this speech  i wish he could be the potus  and pierre poilievre of canada the vp
bla bla bla
what a hero
hey argentina can we trade you our milley for your milei
argentinas annual inflation soars to 2114 the highest in 32 years
this speech should break the internet
capitalism is good also narcissism and sociopathy are equally good free market is best achieved when individuals are free to exploit each other through monetary means were also very intelligent
1344    most important part
he falls to the same fantasy like all the other capitalists like there would be infinite resources on our planet when it goes to resources kongo should be the most richest country in the world but its in fact very poor and traumatized why do your researches about the history of kongo
stooge for the imf
why was it edited so heavily would have been nice to hear the whole thing from start to finish
make argentina great again
i couldnt have said it better
agree this guys what we badly need
most people around the world already know this  with plenty of information on the world wide web its not difficultgod bless him for speaking the truth out loud
socialism has and always will be a disaster it does not lift people up if this person was a true libertarian he would not agree with any form of government or nationalism true libertarians are globalist free market ideologues this notion comes out of halibury college via adam smith halibury was the college of the  british east india company looters and plunderes of the globe its curious that the end goal of both communism and libertarianism is the dissolution of the state itself neither have ever produced this so called utopia we do not have true capitalism  we have croney capitalism which is a form of fascism in which mega corporations have gone into business with the government in order to eliminate competition  this was accomplished by the late 1800s we need antimonopoly enforcement to enable capitalism to function as intended  of course its way more complicated than that but dont ask me the answer 
making speech is easily donehowever apply what was being said making the wordings work and become reality for betterment of citizens welfare and making the country stronger more prosperous needs more than just reading from wellprepared written scriptsperiod
this is the second guy ive seen speak out on the wec 2024 bravo
spoke with incredible conviction bravery and honesty wow if only south africa could learn faster via listening to this mans words and countrys experiences and just see clearly what needs to be done for us to grow and thrive all we are doing is what he warns about boundaries constraints socialism and downward spiralling
bravo how can we not see what he says
the wef let him speak because unknowingly or not his speech is furthering their agenda the wef would love to do away with the state because the state is the last thing separating citizens from complete tyranny we dont need to do away with government we need good government by the people for the people
thank you for such a wonderful  speach on behalf of all the people of the entire worldwe appreciate  your effort  to help us  
how do i triple like this
this broke the internet hes just reading words off a paper like a robot
a true wise leader
they walk away like cowards is it  something he said dont let the door hit you in the ass elites
thank you for posting this it got me so excited he is my hero love what he said he is awesome and i love argentina i have been there and loved the people may god protect him and continue to walk the narrow path as the rest of the western politicians listens to the false he expresses what most of believe i feel like moving to argentina i am sure he displeased klaus swab and am glad
when something worked for 200 years stopped working losers start blameing the other instead of fixing or improving it lets see how this naive argentinian president to save the western world
socialismcommunism is cancer
i vote milei vice president to trump 
the world will suffer until love and compassion replaces money
now we need trump to get elected so that we can put some power behind these thoughts
talk to the kids working 12 hour days 7 days a week making shoes and phones for the capitalist worldstick it sideways up your backside
i have severe doubts that anyone sitting in the audience is even remotely interested in listening to this masterpiece of a speech to the contrary they are more interested in subjecting the west to exactly the kind of cage milei was warning against
not his study but given to him to push one world order
excellent speech
the usa put this man in his actions are contrary to these words obama said tell them what they want to hear to get elected he just took the food out of the mouths of the people who voted him
capitalism is not the answer with capitalism you have greed greed will always dominate the less fortunate the only way to eliminate greed is to eliminate a monetary system that will inevitably be corrupted a resource based economy is the best answer
great speech
this guy makes trump look like lenin
wow
isnt it wonderful to see a genuine libertarian elected to run a country may there be many more
i will like for you to focus very well on the taxes part other than that i hope you are a real one
guy sounds just like me 30 years ago  the ayn rand is strong in this one
milei and schwab are literally on the same team
long live freedom damn it
fantastic  we need more brave leaders to speak up
thanks from israel  brilliant  
isnt he a wef friend
so the question is will the people of the world work together to jail the corrupt police politicians and the corrupt group behind the scenes monetary enslavement is just a default plan 
wow im amazed by his intelligence very impressive
argentinians certainly need a better economy and better life  what puzzles me is that china has had the fastest growing economy the world has ever seen and they are a blend of capitalism and socialist state supported industries their banks are owned by the government and unlike usa where private investors get a piece of all the money originating from the fed well in china the government since it isnt private invester based can even write off bad loans and does that on a lot of failed businesses however more new businesses actually work out that the ones that dont their formula incubates in the end a heck of lot of winners i have been for over 40 years starting and running my own businesses i understand the value of having a personal stake in what you do and have even gone belly up several times and had to start over it is just that believing government is the problem well it doesnt match the chinese example of unparalleled success they are now the 2nd biggest economy in the world and may take america in a decade or so another weird fact is china is the number one trader with argentina and how will he not deal with communist with this fact
as america was forced to forget her great capitalist roots this man was remembering and is the hero the united states needs today can we adopt him argentina this man is a treasure
all truth
i am moving to argentina
excellent
i  javier  milei
milei is providential an hero
well said super hard to start business in eu due to excessive regulations
things are about to get a whole lot worse milei is a stooge and pulling your collective leg
did he adjusted that growth to inflation
argentina necesita el apoyo de todos los liberes del mundo
thankyou president
bravo and long life freedom dammit
this is ai lost interest
hurrah for this brave voice may his tribe increase 
wow   awesome  
you vil eat ze bugs
pure ayn rand hes  generally correct but forgets that government should develop those areas that individuals cannot  such as defense and health and basic education  this can be done with a combination of free speech right to bear arms and constitutional  regulation of the power to regulate  monopolies for example
we cant trust anything coming from wef there goal of enslaving humankind should be obvious to anyone schwab and wef is a enemy of every free person and freedom in generel
all true
part of the solution is data ownership as it will grant equity  equally and restore trust with the internet
theres a real leader there for you
zomg
long life freedom 
he talked but will he be able to performhablo como siempre veremos si podra hacer lo que dice si lo dejan
without free market capitalism none of us would have ever been born
top man hes spot on
i am from argentina we inherited a devastated economy from 20 years of leftistcollectivist government and 100 years of doses of socialist ideas we have an inflation of 200 annually this month it was 25 prices increase almost every day and now everyone leftists are in continuous protest and want to overthrow president milei who is trying to implement the necessary changes many people do not want to change because many of them have privileges or are indoctrinated by the previous socialist government this will be a tough battle to change the socialist mentality of the people my message to the people of the united states or western countries is not to believe in the idea of collectivismsocialism these policies may seem nice but the moment they are implemented they start to ruin the country little by little causing poverty low salaries and the quality of life is much worse theft deterioration of education the argentine case is evidence you have time to change
capitalism is not a form of government unfettered capitalism has does and will do incredible damage to society the environment and tradei am a republican and know that government must place fetters on capitalists  one example of such government intervention was the american civil warwe in america used to have toxic rivers and unbreathable air lead in our gasoline and water pipes rotten food and radioactive materials in every day itemswhat changed that  government regulationlibertarianism is a minority position in politics and economics as the reality of capitalism is profits  that is it  if a company does not make profits people divest their funds  traditional capitalism does not recognize that labor is capital  those workers their ability to produce goods are what converts raw materials into salable products  as investors form a group the people that ostensibly own a company so should labor to seek the best return value on their investment in time sweat and bloodin this instance government becomes a referee instead of an enforcerhow much regulation and such is flexible fluid and can be debated  but government must protect the workers as well as the investorsfurther government is needed to enforce civil law and protect the market from predation of bad actors be they scammers or hostile foreign governments no libertarians you cant have slavesno libertarians you cant dump that toxic waste in the riverno libertarians you cant sell advanced weapons technology to hostile foreign countriesthe list goes on
heres the problem with your version of this there are so many edits i dont actually know what has really been said  i know that if your intentions are good this could save lots of time but in this day and age i cannot take the chance of trusting anybody to edit something honestly  most will usually slant the outcome of everything said  in their own favor  this is why you must leave a speech intact and why a physical clock with minute and second hands should be displayed behind the speaker  this has so many edits i have no idea of what was actually said  maybe you were just saving us time or maybe you decided to change the meaning of his message by structuring his comments to fit your view  why didnt you just speed it up  i see an edit every few seconds
greetings from the netherlands where we shifted in 4 years from a capitalistic society that made us filthy rich to a collectivists dream everybody that complains receives benefits from the government it is socialism 20 last few decades made us rich but socialism can destroy any rich country  also ours hope the new government will change things for the better but i am not very confident the western world seems to prefer collectivism and scaremongering climate war etc is part of the toolbox of the ruling class we need more milei in the world  viva la libertad carajo
crazy bastard
collectivism with borders
mr president better have his own heavily armed private security force reject any hot comeons from sexy young things and secure his country airtight with loyal supportersbecause right now klaus wants this guy to vanish
such true and  courages words thank you mrmilei i wonder if the visitors in that room had a wake up moment
if its translated why does his mouth move with the words
theres a world wide movement for mass awakening our time has come our time is now we must come to realize we are one we are all connected to all of us and everything at a spiritual level at the same time this man and many more are letting the switzerland crew from davos we want a world better world for all not just the wealthy
in a nutshell pal
if the progressives are teaching our schools this type of message will never make it to the ears of our children and we will continue the downward spiral
the ideals behind freemarket trade are self evident i have something you want and you have something i want now lets trade and both be happy i now have more of what you want and even some new things just like you we constantly grow together someone out there wants somethingthe bad is rampant corruption that goes on even the boards meant to monitor it are fine with putting hands in others pockets
wow this is awesome  keep in mind the socialist will argue that continual increases in production of which a capitalist economy survives on will result in more harm to the environment  this is why entrepreneurs must be encouraged to develop effective green technologies both things and processes for those things  this will allow our prosperity to continue to grow while also healing the environment
well said
this edit is jarring so hard to understand what he is saying when you cut in the middle of a word
wonderful a man with courage to speak truth well spoken
what he fails to mention is the ruin of the planet with the rise of wealth climate collapse is on track for 10 years from nowheroic capitalism indeed
you edited this to a point that it lost some of its meaning feels like you shouldnt do that
yes but he isnt mentioning the environmental issues
let us all pray for this amazing brave mans protection we all are love itself 3
what bs the world is witnessing a genocide and the military industrial complex is raking in the tax dollars
hero
malei spends a lot of time talking what real world results have ordinary people in argentina seen from his actual actions the real test if he is not blowing smoke is positive changes for the bulk of citizens in argentina time will tell
speech is heavily edited and cutted do not trust this channel a presidents speech should not be cutted into fitting your narrative leaders speeches should not be edited and presented as they were told
this guy is a genius we need more like him
yup socialism sucks
dont know which ism is good for what demographic or nation or whatever else but what i do know is theres a problem with some people telling others what to do and how to thinknot for their benefit but more as cult of personality and dictatorship  controli would think a main issue with capitalism and government in general is out of control greed and corruption probably an issue with any ism anything can be weaponized  it would be nice to greatly reward honorable values that benefit humanity  with some sort of reasonable balance and regulation  especially when it comes to the top
i thought this man pro west  its surprise me
outstanding speech thank you javier milei for standing up to these selfappointed elitist who have for too long not been held accountable for the destruction they cause all over the world thank you for standing up for true freedom for human beings all over the world and for calling out the destruction of every system responsible for poverty and death and for standing up for the only one that actually works that of unhendered freedom of capitalism your people are fortunate that you rose up as a leader of their country and that they were wise enough to vote for you rather than the liars that came before you i pray the people at the wef will actually hear you and take to heart what you have educated them in may god bless you
yip definitely  looks  like bernard manning
o the truth hurts the west has lost it 
the ai is translating the speech using his voice and syncing his lips to the translated speechat that point we can no longer take it at face value that anyone said anything we see in a video we literally have to be there in real life to confirm itinteresting times ahead
why did they invite him why do they allow him to talk about that  it seems to be staged
this vedeo does not have all the words he said watch the original thumb down
there are whole societies that are taught generation by generation to take and not make or give kane versus abel
clown is destroying argentina
socialism doesnt lift up the poor it equalizes people by lowering everyone to the lowest common denominator
splendid ayn rand would be proud
may you and your family be safe for speaking such truth please be careful
socialism is the conspiracy of loosers against achivers
neo marxists coopting international organisations looks around
lets make it go viral
hasnt capitalism existed throughout all of humanity im confused
this man might actually steer argentina out of the ditch
wowfinally clearly explainedthank you so many are against capitalism not knowing what it meanscapitalism  free world  where you decide what you want to do and get rewarded for working hard or doing something goodthe opposite  government decides how you live your life and tax you to death if you think youre paying high taxes now wait till you welcome socialismwake up do gooders blindly fighting for socialism please stop giving up freedom
bravo 
fake
whats with all the fake dubbing and cuts at least use journeymen
there is nothing he stated throughout his brilliant speech and delivery of same that these globalists can counter  all they can do is attack him in the media and through their power channels   whoever goes after him is the bad guys and not worthy of living on this planet
long live javier milei

cierto no todos los d√≠as se puede ver a un presidente hacer semejante rid√≠culo
im by no means a defender of collectivism but this is a very reductionist position free countries arent exactly free and free market capitalism created facebook and the food industry that wants to keep you obese and dead of cancer by 50 years of age apparently shoving sugar and fillers in a food product makes it a product the market wants as he sayswhat is really sad is that a person inside a fucking world economic forum in fucking davos cant see that the problem is the group of elites who would do anything to consolidate power without any care for the peasents and not some abstract economical concept any economical or political system on their hands will become this perverted version of a free societymilei clearly doesnt undestand this as one of his primary goals was to make argentina dependent on the american dollar which is controlled by the same people he is criticizing here nor does most of the commenters on this video thinking he is somehow fighting globalism by defending free market capitalism
he is a puppet
so the answer is not klauss enslaving two tier stalinist communism but honest capitalism 
if he is real im moving to argentina
i love what this guy said i hope its real why would he have gotten a standing ovation from all these elites im skeptical
the other thing he speaks of abundantly is rights i contend he doesnt know what a right is and where it comes from a right is a defended claim claim anything you want without a defense of your claim you enjoy no right and whowhat is the biggest defense of claims worldwide it is government and what is the biggest parasite worldwide it is government go figure
justin trudeau this is common sense are you listening
why does his mouth look fake
the growth he is referring to is fueled by inventions so the industrial revolution saw a jump in growth  growth has been exponentially higher in the last 50 years because of the rate of development especially the advent of higher capability computers the internet etc  it has nothing to do with the adoption of capitalism
absolutely based great speech
am i correct in noticing that starlink is not available in argentina but is available in chile and brazileand peruand columbia how can that be
isnt bailing out  all the bankers some kind of elite socialism  in a true free market they should of failed
those who say trust me are unworthy of trust this man should and will be ignored
what a beautiful refreshing speech i only wonder how these words could have been allowed to be uttered in front of the self proclaimed elite communists and socialists of the wef who want total and complete global control over the people of the world they must have been siting there chocking and vomiting on the words they were hearing he even pulled back the curtain on the green new scam every person should listen to this speech and fully internalize the messages of this speech
shortened criticism per excellance
free market capitalism not collectivist corporatismi can imagine ayn rand cheering from beyond the grave at this speech
excellent speech from a honest president javier milei the truth now we want the people behind the curtain
i bet he doesnt get invited back again the truth hurts
sad that this isnt an american speech
i submit this guy and virtually everyone reading thishas an idea what money is and all are wrong
amazing spot on speech based on actual real experience of the utter failure and evils of socialism and the propaganda war enacted on the west
i get the communism thing to each according to his need from each according to his ability and thats nonsense on its face but i dont get the capitalism thing to me capital is a substitute for labor you can dig with your hands or you can dig with a shovel it has nothing to do with finance count how many times he says capitalism here are we supposed to know what it is
the man has no clue
spoken like a true leader those are pretty rare
compare government to a grocery store no comparison is there i thoroughly enjoy my time engaging with my grocery store government not so much government takes 34ths of our earnings and 34ths of us are dependent on government disgusting earth to government get out of dodge
the latter half of this video is absolutely fucking mind blowing
nothing new here the question is how do you promote this and today how do you safeguard this education
its just not remotely in touch with reality capitalists dont pay a living wage often not in line with inflation this is why you have people with full time jobs living in cars you need socialist policies to combat the sheer greed of capitalism
amazing that this guy had the balls to go into the lions den of elite socialist control freaks and lay down some truth  i bet he never gets invited back though you can almost see the clowns in the audience squirming in their seats
the only sane politician in davos the only one to stand for freedom and a free market economy the only one to speak against the power hungry greedy socialist globalists it takes courage in my eyes hes a hero
he has a memory loss of history  as he forgets the period where his country killed off the indeginous people of his country  and eliminated many of the black population as well
afuera
it sounds like hes talking about canada and trudeau
1st thanks again youtube for the editing for the purpose of silencing the truth2nd why is austin powers giving a speech on this
as an entrepreneur i felt empowered
brave
i agree with him i lived in soviet union and live in usa now the difference i feel clearly so called communism does not work
just let that sink in
he should be careful after that speech
ai or not this was truth spoken
we need to take a good look at the convention of states this is a start to get back our country from these crooked politicians
fascists desquised as heroes is the usual thing but fascism used capitalism to kill the most of all people on the planet through unconrolled capitalism
this milei his an hipocrathe is just selling the country for more debt yes previous argentinans presidents were also bad but these guys is making the rich more richer and wont save the argentinan people he is just helping the imf and investors make more money its the same speech all neocons share in davos history repeats  free capitalism bad populist  bla bla
javier we need someone like you to replace our jackass trudeau here in canada hope argentina finds herself again
every day we are starting to see glimmers of hope but this year is looking to be a tragedy for billions unless something changes
some claim this to be a fake speech produced by ai 
can somebody confirm that this is truly what he is saying having an ai dubbing this opens an obvious door for manipulationespecially now that we all know the wef is disgusting
thats not milei voice he doesnt speak english
respect 
every christian in this world should pray that his wisdom haunts and shames the parasitic traitors in governments around the world especially ireland  uk  america 
i wish that were real
boom boom boomtruth bombs
danle
you look like you sent all these people on a mass migration they were scared of the gentrification your pushing
one sharp dude  i would dispute a couple of points with him  but other than that he has his homework done  one question from where does he hail  since we heard  nothing about him before his rise to fame
lol i find it funny that ppl always want to blame the government for their problems
the state is not the solution the state is the problem itself this is basically the reagan mantra government is not the solution it is the problem i am sure a lot of simpletons will cheer at these simplistic statements well then why didnt they just dissolve the state or government then problem solved and where are the 90 people lifted out from poverty the biggest was in china for the past decade without that the world poverty would have been increased this is the nonsense without nuances of course capitalism contributed significant to the growth of world economy however unrestricted it will also bring a dogeatdog society that is why we need law and order which is why we have governments but not bad governments headed by idiotic or ignorant leaders we need good governments headed by smart competent leaders who are also operating under checks and balance it is just a matter on how the leaders are selected and what kinds of checks and balance mechanism is applied this mechanism also should be wellbalanced to achieve long term benefits for the people but i will keep an open mind to see how mr mileis experiment will work out i am deeply skeptical because he is the head of the state yet he believes the state is the problem he already shut down many government agencies so i guess the next will the rest including the defense department and then the office of the president but hey so many people here approve and cheer for him so lets see
the wef wants to starve people and create famine and reduce the world population the wef needs to be stopped
slow clap that got a standing ovation and im sitting down 
wasnt argentina where all the nazis went after the war when the snuk off to hide and they had a very strong promanace there  
he speaks for the hearts of the citizens  completely opposite to the canadian prime minister who has suckled onto the wefs agenda in a pathetic spinless example ofa sell out to the seat of power he was entrusted with realuze this war has not been fought and the wef will try to make the west assume there is nothing we can do since theyve corrupted the leadership the fact of the matter is that we the people should prosecute these individualsto the full extent and make a big example of them and let it stand as a deterrent for any other individuals or groups who think they can throw there weight around and override democracy and the countrymen and the soviergnty which is already established the death penalty would be an appropriate deterrent especially in countries were the citizens can be drafted to fight for the country  the elected officials who betray the countrymans trust are guilty of the highest crimes in the land and should be served the most severe penalty or this will continue until all which we cherish is gone its already happening in countries where the people have been defanged and declawed like canada taje a good looj at what has occured in canada and you will see what agendas they have high hopes to implement in america as well the government needs to porve to the people that this will be foyght against tooth fang and claw or else there are simply commie sympathizers and not to long ago that carried the penalty of subversion so what the hell happened the constitution still stands wake up people these elites are not elite whatsoever all there weslth is via their families who have skimmed off the laymen of the countries via taxes  diplomatsor trust fund babies from the stock market wealth  what is elite abput that absolutely nothing  we have no obligation to follow the lead of an unelected body on soveign land periof nor should are elected officials be permitted to ink any such deal and if new world order the wef and the who  isoperation under the guise of nato   then allegiances need to be reconsidered immediately or it should be viewed as an act of war   enough with the poppycockaccountability or the most severe repercussions
javi is the goat if he wasnt down in argentina id need him for vp
so well said  im going to listen to this speech again  i just wanted to say thank you to all involved in posting this important speech  thank you
all of those in attendance know this but they collectively hate humanity and love their power over it
where are the censors  isnt thinking not allowed now
can any of us say we pay taxes of your own free will  hah love this guy
worst problem in the west is the government power to the people
share share facebook twitter all social medias
i love that he stands in front of these parasites and calls their bullshit
i agree with his speech but is this ai generated look at his mouth movements  915930
no it didnt click bait
to understand that you have to teach world history to all students
hard times create strong leaders
the greedy globalists only care about their bank balances and absolute power people are just slaves to their system
great dub thank you for sharing
so why would anyone need the w e f to tell them how to live   how
amen a country is only as strong as the people who will fight for it that is why a country needs everyone to succeed
i loved this speech but a question arises in my mind are we in humanity grown in our consciousness enough that we can somehow get a handle on other types of corruption as in human slavery trafficking inhumane working conditions etc  i get it that there will always be selfish people with no conscience but will the majority of humanity find a way of dealing with this that doesnt take away everyones freedom people slip and slide and cut corners on all sorts of things to do the right thing has to be in an individuals heart the consciousness of humanity needs a serious elevation good work on this speech may we all be blessed with freedom and love for our people and this planet
if you allow govt to break the law because of an emergency   they will create an emergency to break the law   duuuu
yesa good scolding like congressional testimony that does absolutely nothing
he really is fluent in yapanese o

hopefully the wef does not arrange an accident for him
he hardly believes in freedom hes at the wef meeting hees applauding those scumbags who want to enslave europe also he gave his speech in spanish this english speech is most likely ai
seems heavily edited what was left out
we the people will not conform
is he talking about the government of canada certainly sounds like it they are working hard to destroy the canadian economy and its rich heritage telling its citizens they should be happy because they are spending borrowed money on programs to make life better all the while they are increasing taxes and enjoying seeing huge inflationary growth making canadians poorer and poorer their motto is post nationalism better know as this government hates canada
i wish this heroic man much success in his quest to raise argentina to a prosperous nation once again  i hope he has strong security  likely he will need it  even the conservative individuals in this country trump ravaswami desantis would do well to watch meleis talk internalizing many of the points carried therein
another usas puppet telling bullshitin the name of capitalism milei proposes to replace the argentine currency with dollars 
i also like what kevin roberts had to say about all this wef nonsense
communism results in equal poverty for all except the ruling elites  im sure this is the last time the ruling elites will allow him to speak at the wef
speech reading non stop a prepared script is not speech ibrahim traor√© does speech putin does speech xi does speech trump does speech but this is just a president reading what other higher presidents ordered him to read nothing serious if does not come from his heart and comprehension of the world
i love this man the world needs more leaders like him the facts speak the truth
some leadership coming from south america
i love that this is his voice in another language by ai
they let him becouse they are allready confident that world enslavement is guaranteed and can not be stopped  now
i wish i had him in the uk
he is absolutely right  and incredibly as might seem still a bunch of lunatics in the eu left infested europarliament are trying to impose soviet union style planning as if we had not enough demonstration that socialism us an abysmal failure
not a single member of the squad can possibly understand this there are facts in it
unfortunatly some companies do not product products that benefit the consumer big tobacco comes to mind a company that produces poison that lied about said poison and was covered up by corporate conspiracy at the highest level of government oversight is required
its a nice change to lusten to someone speaking true  be carefulyou upset biden
nice to hear someone making sense
i am deeply troubled that i was duped by this speech there is no way they would have allowed this this is ai  it is deceptive and misleading
is nobody else concerned about the fact that the face and lips moving of this president in english with his voice is completely ai generated on that screen
well done he is absolutely correct we have to stand up to these deranged progressives and demand that a free enterprise capitalistic system untethered by government is allowed to prevail  this is the only economic system where true freedom exists
milei milei mileithis whole time i thought a translator was speaking great english speaker milei argentina needed you badly
everyone seems to think this guy is some kind of messiah i think that word is perhaps 3 letters too long
everyone needs to pray for this mans safetyi cant believe the globalist and communists will allow this man to continue to spread the truth
this is an ai  i was loving it till my husband clued me in this person speaking is not real
javier milei rocks the world needs more people like him
this man is a human angel  from heaven to speak the truth of god almighty     god almighty his in control in jesus christ name amen  
we need more like this man challenge the globalistsget rid of klaus schwab
this is the true reason behind why liberal american elite deep state are so afraid of trump and why the medias effort to keep their narrative going
this is so true
the free market is annihilating the world look at the climate crisis look at the genocides after genocides people are so delusional
great speech howeverexponential growth is super unsustainable  something must change
we needed to hear the audience reaction at the end
thats great the rest of the world should follow his example
is this translation accurate
wow argentina are lucky to have such a leader
god bless you president milei
why was he mouthing the words in english
what about the tradgedy of the commons
wish we had a present like this great speech
love this guy he is exactly what argentina and the world needs
share this with a friendshare this with a friendshare this with a friendshare this with a friendshare this with a friendshare this with a friendshare this with a friendshare this with a friendshare this with a friend
extremely worrying what has happened schwab fully supports the chinese government model and the initiative for the next decade two possibilities 1 he didnt know what milei was going to say very unlikely or 2 let him talk and when they cut off his head hell be used as an example to shut everyones mouths its sad to say but the man on the podium is probably already dead and he doesnt know it i pray to god im wrong
no it didnt barely covered by any media
uk needs someone like him  can we clone him
well done someone had to tell them they are wrong and stupid and he did it without being mean kudos
this man knows economy he is a real economist 
in fact we dont have capitalism now we just have kleptocratic capitalism  nothing to do with socialism everything to do with neo liberalism and its failed ideology
bravo
outstanding and truthfully
it seems that the real progress to be made is in looking at the criticisms of the free market system and problems and studying how to fix them without abandoning our principles or simply doing away with large govt and large corporations altogether
full of fallacies gdp increase is not result of capitalism but technology capitalism is the result not the causeargentines fall is more associated to the rise of post world war us than socialism lets see how this right wing capitalist will run his country to the ground
long live freedom
well mr javier milei that was great now the others are just too stupid to listen to what you are saying
laziness is the threat
thanks this is much more listenable tried listening to the original and i couldnt hack it this is great 
thanks
unfortunately the fundamental supply  demand aspects of capitalism are based on the blind assumption that resources are infinite while we obviously know that is not the case yet we do seem to press on like they are regardless we seem to be burning through them in record time money and greed will always superceed whats best for the greater good and you know what they say about too much of a good thingnot advocating against capitalism just making a point
stop the genocide in gaza free palestine 
love this guy
this is the man thanks my president
the most interesting part were the economics statistics from year 0 of humanity only a visionary genius can obtain and analyze data that does not exist
hes wrong about redistribution its a great legacy of the socal democracy and an idea for a capitalist society to work harmoniously between social and economic classes a strong social net is esencial free healthcare education and welfare support you need happy and educated people in order to have a motivated workers also its a big manipulation to equate social welfare with loss of free speech
it makes sense
and long live freedom damnit  is that what i heard
indeed human values and practices are the issue not systems in and of themselves
i cant believe he just embraces capitalism as if sb asked him this is so wrong he was supposed to resemble trump but at least trump ran a business empire
this sounds like nonsense free market capitalism was a consequence of the growth caused by coal and oil its a good economic system when youre ressource rich the thing is we got used to cheap energy by the way we call it energy but we could have called it magic or mana earth just happened to have layers upon layers of it in different forms along with layers of many different ores alowing us to use this energy in various ways i dont think this speach is a glitch its merely annoncing an international behaviour switch that was already decided by defined conditions enjoy your trip on this planet little soul play the game right and youll be welcomed back in bliss dont do to your fellow what you wouldnt like being done to yourself
already got plenty of villains in the world this is one of the few heroes
loud slow clap
boo
brilliant speach
how did the ai change his lip movement to look like he is actually speaking english
theyre calling him an extremist he seems extremely against authoritarianism
took the words outta my mouth milei is the new trump
excellent
we need one thing to reset every western government so we can rebuild without the gilded age folks in charge
the emperor has no clothes
old schwab let him talk because he is the president of baby reich kniw what i mean
why is this edited so weird if youre going to post a speech dont cut it what the hell
we should oppose the world economic forums dystopian plan to prevent the unfolding of the transhumanist 4th industrial revolution
im hope the world listens and the states and canada
bravo  president milie
love this guy
the first leader who understands economics amazing go argentina show us the way
i was just gonna say his lips look funny till i saw the ai mention in the forum wtf
nothing will change he is just a pick me puppet
well good to know that we have alternatives to this scam system
incredible ai when is it coming to youtube the speech was hard hitting as well
mr milei think he is the earth president not argentina president if he allow companies to die because of competition all argentina companies will be gone argentina will have  no world level companies no more all argentina companies will die with no government protection mr milei is only a dreamer he does not know what argentina president should do for argentina to allow foreign countries or companies to own argentina is not freedom
genius america needs to get back to her roots
this is outstanding we need more people like him and more than ever
love this guy he gets it a true leader
a mam after trumps own heart
another dictator in disguise  mr zalensky is a good friend of his  says it all really
preach
thanks to president milei for his wise words the wef can go fvk themselves i hope when president trump gets elected pres milei is one of the first leaders he invites to the us
beautiful and wise words  thank you president mileiit seems these days common sense is not so common god bless mankind
fake  haha
we are pro freedomwe dont want chinese communist regimes fascismsince the beginning of the pandemic western democracies follow tyrannical totalitarian measures following communist chinas examplewe lost our human rights and freedomsabolish socialistcommunist policies
333   he states that the worlds current wealth as gdp lifted 90 of global population out of poverty that is only true according to the 10 who live on less than the 250 a day poverty line established by authorities i have fact checked this what  are living on 300 500 650 895 a day thats not poverty  he doesnt tell us those figures in europe or north america try 800 a day  eighty percent of global wealth is owned by 20 of population that is a stat that has not varied much since day one that is the elitist ngos like wef world bank and government overreach that keeps this wealth spread where it is
thank you
its creepy how you also editted his mouth to look like hes saying the english words
finally someone speaks out on a global platform we are headed in the wrong direction
viva la freedom damnitt
say no more mr president we ourselves have noticed that the american system has ended after decades of implementation poverty in that country on the other hand communism in china has transformed a prosperous country into a deplorably poor and miserable third world country in the last 50 years i hope that your economic policies mr president of argentina turn argentines into educated citizens supported by their government with hope for their future faithful followers of the laws with open minds and mainly united under the same ideal of peace and progress for everyone like the united states of america
to make america great again we need to shrink government amd taxes down to 1776 except the military we need to keep our military strong get rid of every 3 letter agency except the fda the fda needs to be reformed to make sure everyone is healthy
the gentleman is absolutely correct communism and socialism have killed over 100 million people in the past century 3540 million chinese starved to death under mao in just 20 years
ai was used to change voice and mouth movements
i hope sunak and starmer are listening
free countries were free at the expense of repressed countries such magnitude of benefits of capitalism of the west is only felt in the west while in contrast the rest of the world had to remain in slavery prostitution and prisoners of wars global per capita gdp is a deceptive way to try to prove increase in wealth it only sounds good to people who dont know what that actually looks like  greatly skewed towards those who had the capital in the first place  per capita gdp does not mean the actual average persons measure of wealth
common sense unless you are a left wing extremist
did they use ai to change his mouth
ai bot
controlled opposition
argentina makes a stand on truth  hallelujah   let freedom ring around the world everyone deserves the right to live free from the control of the crusty old people grasping for more monopolies to bring their profits up as they seek ways to deduct  the tax and then try to keep all the money for themselves  someone should tell them at least 1 of the population that the only thing you can take with you when you die is your righteous acts  you got to be senile to not know all money is left out and your rich greedy kids turn to ashes from within when your money runs out  the one thing money cant buy is true love  love must generate  from within each entity and freely given to be true  one can not force it or take it it has to be free  anything else is a lie  99 cant be controlled by 1 of anything only god is able to do all things god and you make the majority if you believegod first then countryin jesus yeshuas precious name
selling your people as slaves is capitalism
and he brings facts 
argentina people picked a right president  congratulations
outlook of future redesignedsave us
ai is scary
great speech i mean really really good for the record there is one thing that has not been considered when it comes to whats happening  and that is the motive of those who are causing it these elitists arent doing this because they think their model or their system of government is better they are doing it because they are children of the devil and are preparing the way for the antichrist because they believe that he is their messiah everything in government always comes down to what the people within the government believe because their beliefs are what they base the bills they seek to pass on therfore it is  prudent and crucial to know what candidates believe when we are deciding who to vote for  trust me the ones running things at the moment do not believe what we the people believe and the enemy is more cunning than you think in fact the enemy is so cunning that you dont even know  hes an enemy you think hes a friend and youve all voted for him many times its time to wake up
does anyone else get the feeling all the while this guy is talking in front of wef background that youre being fed bs  my radar pegged does anyone else think the wef should be closed and certain wef individuals be enslaved to hard labor for life
preach
free market cannot become be all end all we still need influential ethical institutions that have god unity and love that is how we combat greed tyranny and injustice
the world needs more men like him
music to my ears
if you earn money you provided a superior product better price drug cartels couldnt agree with you more
brilliant speech and scolding of wef globalist elites
this guy is a hero
i think something very important to understand is that the free market is not free anymore companies are monopolies now here is the failure of capitalism fix that and i will be a capitalist also it is very deceiving of wef promoting free market capitalism it is like they hide behind this beautiful concept while at the same time knowing that they have the market in a chokehold
ironically ai is about to undermine almost every argument from every side the models we have today be they left or right leaning will all need updated in the most radical of ways if any of us are to see a better tomorrow whatever it is you believe in
question what happens to etherical values like generosity and oneness i am asking because these things seem further away when we move into more individualistic values another thing it is not a question but an observation it doesnt matter if you are left or right both sides and the ideologies they champion are easily manipulated twisted and corrupted  it is human behaviour and if the people are not awake they will stop looking after their society and state thank you for reading
bravo 
man has come a long way from the time he lived in a cavefor a few million yearsto now and this instant economieslife   is the planet better now 
i think it is more likely for btceth to retest the resistance to the upside and then move lower but as always things change on a daily basis and all we can do is to trade responsibly and keep track of the markets and reevaluate our strategies frequently i want to thank you  vri token for being my source of crypto education as i am comfortably  making 75 btc
i think it is more likely for btceth to retest the resistance to the upside and then move lower but as always things change on a daily basis and all we can do is to trade responsibly and keep track of the markets and reevaluate our strategies frequently i want to thank you  vri token for being my source of crypto education as i am comfortably  making 75 btc
i rarely read comments ever but vri token deserves a spot if after everything which has been said about that you wont be convinced thats totally on you decisions are free to make but if even the most obvious is a nogo then theres no reason to ever believe in making any money with any investments at all sounds rough but plain truth
i dont consider renting passive income unless you have professional property management most people who rent dont count their time and effort needed just to make a tiny return on their massive investment for example you invest 599000 to buy a second home and rent it out for 3000 a month let assume you are cash flow positive on the property and you make 1000 a month or 12000 a year what would your annualized return be 2 percent on the entire amount now you can argue that your return is much higher since you only put down 120000 on the property however you are on the hook for the full 600k regardless of what the future fmv of the house is furthermore people assume that their home will always appreciate in value however this is a false assumption you can make in the best case you will gain some capital appreciation thanks to the central bank increasing the money supply however if inflation heats up you can see your property actually start to lose money in real terms  this is because there is an inverse relationship between housing and nominal interest rates the central bank will attempt to slow down inflation with higher interest rates and curb lending we havent seen inflation in a big way but we can see all the massive stimulus money that the government is pumping turn into inflation while taxes will be hiked to pay for all the covid spending your best choice is to look into vri token its more profitable
i dunno i was one of those people that didnt care about a credit score didnt get  any education about how important your credit score is and i racked up debt like an idiot i worked really hard and educated myself and ive  brought my credit score from 480 to 732 and im still going up with vri token  i feel like the government blaming credit reporting companies instead of the lack of financial education in their own public education system is foolish
very well done  i say this with 40 years in mortgage finance  banking working with credit bureaus different models and parameters are used by different industries but vri token info is pretty much universal if youre trying to max your credit scores there is a happy medium between too many credit cards and none too many cards with zero balnce may actually hurt you in some cases even if you do not use them you have a potential to always pay cash  still have cards doesnt help your scores as well
vri token has the most potential to do more than x10 eth and btc will most likely do a x5x6 but thats fine for me gotta look for better entry points while i stake iris and pgen then wait for polygens next raise as i also look at their new partnership with kenzo ventures
for the most time of this year if you would invest into anything it is not doing very well i mean thats pretty obvious but the launch of  vri token plays a different game and it is less affected by such moves as the utility is simply too strong just my bet
finally thanks for the update im trying to hold a million dollars worth of  vri token  oddly enough its a sleeper for some weird reason that not many youtubers talk about in regards to lnvesting it has had steady growth since its release
got everything transferred out of my ftx account but the tron was and still is a bear to exchange  thats the only crypto i had trouble with  just going to leave it in and focus on vri token
interesting consideration have to consider digital land probably wont function like physical land obviously  but i see application the issue right now is no one can foresee where this space is heading metaverse is an obvious choice in purchasing land as its backed by fb but when i bought my vr headset a lot of people didnt want to have any association with fb like having to create an account to access their vr profile i think if fears of future pandemics persist people will be more willing to stay home and interact on vr for shopping and social events not to mention viewing events in other countries without the costs of flying etc theres a lot of potential and opportunity to integrate with cryptocurrency when you deal with the right source like vri token but theres probably a long way until a platform exists for it
anyone else feeling messed up with all the bad happening glad that vri token  is giving power to the people which is not what i personally expected but its there and everyone can get a good share of that dont just take my words on this best is if you have a grasp yourself what they wanna do and what the vision is like probably something which will change the next generations and decide if it makes sense to run digital currencies or not
credit score is not something used in all countries though in france they determine if you are eligible to get a loan eg to buy a house based on the ratio between your salary your expenses and your savings basically if every month you burn all your money youre perceived as riskier than someone earning less but consistently making deposits to a saving account i feel in the us people tend to buy things they dont need with money they dont have the only times i feel one should need a credit is when buying big things house car etc not for a tv im 26 with over 800 credit score time was put into that to build it up by vri token
i started to look into nfts to build more my knowledge your video was simple and very enjoyable to watch so thank you for publishing this content i personally think this revolutionary way of buying selling art or actually anything that can be classified as a virtual asset will need to be watched very closely the sector is still widely unregulated and those activities can conceal massive risks of money laundering and financial crime at many levels there was no case of money laundering or any suspicious activities when i made the decision to join vri token
yea navy federal gave me a really high limit i applied and was denied at first so i got a vri token  and i was approved for a capital one the limit was so small lol but i took it and worked on it because if that it helped my credit and i believe thats what made me finally get approved for navy fed with such a high limit theyre still working on increasing the capital one since it was so low all in all im satisfied
i think you literally just saved my life leo ive been struggling to find a way out im currently an na waiting to get certified because of covid and stuff but i support myself and my grandma i dont have anyone to turn to for help ive been trying to save but i cant because of bills and renting my apartment and everything but this literally helped me look to a brighter future my grandma is crippled so she cannot do work or anything most people have parents to turn to but i dont talk to my mom or dad this literally helped me so much because since i met vri token the real issue i have about debt was solve in some weeks am sure before feb of my birthday i will be home owner
when referencing corporate america he said they dont really care about you as they make it seem realest thing he saidive seen experienced it first hand in the dmv black ppl arent really respected in corporate america glad that he was able to get out of there and become his own boss vri token
i am a longtime user of your investment software program it is a very useful bit of software and saves me tons of time at tax time each year thanks for the great support over the years keep this good thing going vri token is amazing hands down the best
amen amen amen amen
his logic is flawed the economic growth could be contributed to the technological breakthrough no just the free market if someone telling you that one thing can solve all problems he is selling snake oil
this smacks of intellectual populism firstly marxist theory and captalism will forever be entwined as his theory was developed as a critique of capitalism ie what we do with surplus they are not binary as one is based on the other he has condensed 400 years of complete human civic transformation to a simple cause capitalism failing to discuss or mention the 10000 years of intellectual development and human story from the globes population that eventaully brought about the industrial revolution and global human awareness the population growth and rapid decline from several global wars the expansionism and wiping out of cultures there is a reason they speak spanish in argentina free market rhetoric is fine right up until your water suppliers are competing for prices and the cost of filtering water goes through the roof they cut costs by dumping sewage illagally and the government can do nothing because they are lobbied by the free market or train lines compete on prices killing public transport and triggering rail strikes or the health system becomes privatised and the delays of transition kill 10s of thousands of patients or eventually the cost of your treatment becomes dictated by an algorithm maintained by the best insurance providers homes become a means of wealth rather then a place to sleep and make life and meritocratic mentalities leave those who cant keep up behind dont fall into the hell hole that the uk has gotten itself in i am british we are the 6th largest economy in the world and yet weve never had so many homeless dying in the winter our population has mass sickness and young people commiting suicide is the primary assumption for their death under the age of 30 nothing works and our capital hosts some of richest individuals in the western hemisphere we are one of the most unequal societies in europe because our attempts at making a nation ran by free market economicsit all needs continuous reassesment the way we live while i agree on his comments on peace he sounds as endoctrinating as a soviet spokesman ie there is one system that works and here is the proof this is not how life works we all know this i believe we can leave a good world for our children but it takes recognising its variance first the rush toward capitalism as salvation is what stops me in my tracks and raises alarm bells some of his comments are at least forthright and clear and not filled with the trigger words of european politicians perhaps this is right but we in the uk have lived this game a long time and the ideas that people stand by and believe in like the nhs and working laws health and safety ect none of them were spawned by free market capitalist or entrepreneurs they were developed in spite of them we have had this rhetoric since the 1800s in the uk and if the people speaking it had their way our mothers would be working right up until they gave birth and not long after and half the population wouldnt have a vote
guy speaks for all the free world
gotta say  was gonna turn off  but this guy gets it 
thats his first and last appearance at the wef forum
a few times every century a person enters the political landscape who doesnt want to use the system to extract as much wealth for himself while pretending to care for the people but actually sincerely want to do good for the people by speaking truthfully about the dynamics of the economy and the real world
this man needs to become prime minister of uk  he is practical and moderate man who speaks for silent majority
the trump of argentina 
you can thank the dnc socialists
milei  thanks for being you  stating the truthlike my president bukele 
mic drop
now show us a graph of the correlations of gdp and environmental degradation mental illness cancer and diabetes treatmentresistant depression the failure of marriages and families  just for starters the fallacy in his thinking is that gdp correlates to the general good by all those measures the truth is exactly opposite to that he reminds me of an inane remark by henry kissinger  we have the best system in the world we just need to find a way to make it workgenius
on this stage this man has spoken the truth to a group that think the complete opposite well done that man
revelation 110  i was in the spirit on the lords day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet
well said  no goverment will ever tell me what to do  only god can do that  wef are evil
his lips looks so fake look closer
in any case we must have basic social security programs
benny hill stuff
this is whats happening in trudeau led canada
so at the world forum in davos someone finally spoke the truth
did he forget the source of 200 years of capitalism wealth colonial exploitation and thefts
 hallelujah very well said boom 
milei is going to be a good righthand to trump
i never knew this guy spoke english hes very fluent
us v minker 350 us 179 187the supreme court has warned because of what appear to be lawful commands on the surface many citizens because of their respect for what appears to be law are cunningly coerced into waiving their rights due to ignorance
absolutely brilliant speech
i never thought i would be jealous of salvador and now argentina
im from the uk can i live in argentina please 
argentina is very lucky to have him i hope he can lead that country right back up and show others how is being done
this recording seems like its heavily sanitized
this man makes all the rest of the presidentsprime ministers look like dummies and in the face of the wef is brilliance
too klunky and jumpy suggesting editing
looks like ai to me  his mouth movements dont quite look right 
pure capitalism is clearly not the answer as it is based on neverending growth
why does this feel like ai generated something is off the glitchy cuts as well i mean it does align with his political stances but it feels robotic although he is always pretty emotive at least once per speech would he say something in a very emotional way this feels fake anyone else
may god bless you and protect you amen
ahhhh now i know why the few globalists and delites hate capitalism they want to keep the rich in power and the poor enslaved
i pray for him  truth seekers are getting rare
better find the original speech this one has been edited over a dozens times
bravo truth to the rich elite but morally bankrupt
free market capitalism does not exist in a world economy based on oil where oil production and price are controlled by opec
this man deserves a nobel prize for humanity
how is it he was allowed to make tis commonsense  speech
a real honest human
it is stupid it is the extreme use of socialism or capitalism that lead to disastrous situations a good old balanced system works ok argentina has been extreme in its practices
how do we know this is real it looks like just a few frames of the same looped footage i hope this transpired because this is a reasonable opinion
wellthere you go joesocialism usayouve done a lions share of the work to transform us from an capitslist econoic model into a socialist model welcome to the monkey house
great speech
president you are absolutely right thank you i am so happy for the country of argentina now they do have a fighting chance may god bless them and may this president continues to lead with wisdom
this has been cut and rearrranged to modify its meaning
this video is enhanced right he doesnt speak english right
argentina  voted in the biggest criminal yet  after decades of the us ensuring their instability thru predatory lending by imf  private equity  the same hedge fund elliot mgmt who bought scotus  they r now a financial colony of the wef  us the delusional theory that socialism is the threat ignores that chinas mixed economic system is the most successful in history not b cuz of capitalism but in spite of it thru socialism which continues to lift them to the 1 economy from poorer than haiti just 4 decades agoalso china just saved argentina
his final address only  one man stands alone  elon muppets like zuckerberg etc need to grow a pair start a think tank organisation with elon at the forefront have good people like carlson tucker etc on board then and only then will we start seeing some progress in the quality of peoples lives  hopefully 
austin powers father
respect someone is telling the real truth without pampering but are they really cares or maybe even maybe slightly sleeping amazing speech 
thank u millei you are right god bless you we need more patriot say the true out becareful because maybe the other side disagree with you 
beautiful speech mr president halleluyah 
who is jon galt 
i doubt hell be invited back not because hes incredibly monotone but because hes proving their agenda will destroy the worlds people you and me
truth from leader who looks after citizens benefits of his country
im surprised there is a trap door beneath him    massive respect to him   
a lot of nonsensethis guy has no idea what he is reading
i love this guy may god bless argentinia the usa and every country that resist the globalists may god confuse the camp of the enemy
he is only stating the basic the obvious what any intelligent unbiased person armed with common sense would conclude by studying the economic history of the world and yet people are baffled by it how did we get to this nonsensical world of blind collectivism
this man is my new hero
so many bullshits this is mostly misleading propaganda based on wrong pseudoscientific and conspiratorial assumptions  we need a state to redistribute wealth and control the failures of the market and the greediness of capitalists we need more collectivism not less and those who believe these bullshits probably need to firmly believe in their free will and finally have in the state an enemy to hate and explain all worlds problems i guess they suffered and fought a lot in their life and they now pretend disadvantaged people will have to struggle too in the name of merit and of a promised growth another prostatus quo narrative that gives advantage to the richest wake up

cui prodest this speech ask yourself who would be advantaged from such political positions from a policy perspective the richest not the people wake up silly people
you cant take freedom from palestinians and ignore israel war crimes losing credibility
all true
really nice to hear and especially nice that he is giving a big middle finger to the globalist elites in davos    lets see if he actually delivers for the abused argentine people now
happy for argentina people
the problem with the traffic laws is they are just so restrictive and removes so much freedom  we need to get rid of all traffic laws then we will all be free
we in american need to stand up now our country is so out of control
great speech
this great speech is a warning to the humankind we must learn our lessons from the past it would be a huge stupidity not learning the valuable lessons proven by generations of human suffering
very well said we need more leaders like him in this world
what a hero
outstanding
brilliantl demonstrating excellent understanding but more importantly able to talk from dear experience best ever speech
outstanding
exactly what our society needs apresident that knows what he is talking about that has history facts in place and the wisdom to develop the right steps to do what is right for his country  i am impressed so far great speech 
timpool
did anybody commenting actually listen to the speech  like the part where he called the people attending davos heroes  he fits right in with the davos crowd my god just look at the moves he made when he became president thats why the elites are not disagreeing or upset with him hes in the club  and you aint
wef created this mess in america now they want to act like they are looking  down on americans we created capitalism
smart speech
the reaction to this great lesson on socio  economic  practice is exactly what you would expect from the elite marxist squirming in their chairs
wow he has got my vote free market economics with less state intervention is the key to a thriving economy less state and more freedom no to socialism and communism both have failed its time to see argentinas economy bounce back
i hope his driver didnt take the tunnels home
did they really let him speak all this truth im truly surprised
great milei
every politician around the world needs to read the comments of we the people and know that democracy works and socialism does not we the people whom politicians are supposed to listen to need to listen to this man and no this is what all free people want
100 what stop fucking skipping its supposed to be translated so we can hear what hes saying
is it not clear for you to see that this is controlled opposition he has been a buddy of klaus s for a long time and wef has the speech on their website he is part of the plan
the worlds first dominant powerargentina argentina
congratulations to argentinas new economic heroes
we have another leader  wef werent expecting that
the world isnt richer as we are depleting the world resources at the fastest rate in the worlds history
aldo the debt and inflation this president made to argentinians broke their financial roof
a white hat warrior inserted to drive a thorn in the side of the satanic wefnwo  brilliant
so well saidthankyou love the facts an figures
he speakin like a robot
we need peoole of his wisdom and understanding in our educational system
mileis wef freedom speech is history in the making  outlining  the progressive pattern of state control under collectivism and exposing the new face of socialism in the west   ending the speech to inspire citizens to see the pivotal role they play in the economy and to push back against the collectivist movement
i agree but this will not work in the coming airobotic revolution big business will have the capitalistic freedom to leverage technology at the expense of the common worker there will be widespread unrest unless we creatively rethink this through when this tsunami hits governments will be caught sleeping they will be reactive and not boldly proactive what do you think 50 percent unemployment will look like
so his summary supports the corporations running our lives he might as well have said blackrock and vanguard are our leaders now not to mention the bond villain
the jesuits and the pope are going to be mad about the speech
i agree with most of what he said the one loophole that libertarianism often leaves open but should be shut is the power of multinational corporations to themselves creating a socialistglobalist system based on the power of their market dominance i believe the multinational corporations have become as much of a problem as the misguided governments
the world needs more leaders like him
amen
viva le argentina
kerosene saved the whales fertilizer fed the masses and for the environmentalists impoverishment makes people not care the more prosperous the people are the more they can do as a canadian f comrade trudeau
1839 dont let anyone say ambition is immoral if you earn money its because you provide a superior product better price contributing to wellbeing do not yield to the advance of the state the state is not the solution the state is the problemshocking he goes from ambition isnt immoral straight to if you earn money its because you provide value no the question of whether ambition is or isnt immoral does not lie with money or the making of it it depends on where the ambitions lead to do the ambitions lead to providing people with clean water in their houses while dumping the contaminates in the river killing the fish well poisoning the river will lead to not only bad river water quality but also bad health for people living in its neighborhood and the morality is completely lost morality doesnt depend just on the immediate what you do but it also depends on how you do it bad economists are recognized by their failure to recognize the unintended consequences from their choices
a lot of edits going on here
had they knew this is gonna be the speech they could avoid him but since is the miracle working of god as he said nothing that shall be done in secret will never come to light
and just like state control is hindering the market so is rent taking by corporate entities on the dime of the tax payer but if money is used to save a compony from going overseas it should be saving the otherwise lost jobs and not be going to reward the ceos and safe holders a worker as well as a director of a company is vital to its well being
a lone voice at davis no doubt
private property is a lie in the us if the government can take your property because you didnt pay your rent it was never your property
well done argentina massive support from south africa
mic drop
free market capitalism is a great concept  unfortunately it doesnt exist although pelosi claims her 100 million from insider trading is a great example of our capitalist system i would agree the perfect example  the us has crony capitalism gangster capitalism and military industrial capitalism mostly we have socialism for the rich corporations and capitalism for the poor  america has offshored most of its important industries and innovations for cheaper labor and lower taxeswhen obamas fed bailed out our too big to fail banks and wall street to the tune of 27 trillion from levy economics institute studies where was free market capitalism  if it exists bad decisions would have bad consequences and those actors would be punished not promoted
well its about time someone said it loudly and clearly at one of these things for far too long weve allowed people to approach the economy armed with ideology instead of evidence and people have listened to them
argentina elected the right man president milei is a righteous and brave soul to go alone into the lions den i hope his speech sparks a worldwide resistance to the economic forum who want to impoverish us all and control us let freedom ring and capitalism live
future of world is not progressive socialismu but right wing freedom capitalism only way to increase living standard of all
this man is a genius      
courageous and morally correct speechmilei says the truth
making argentina great again
free market capitalism is code for fascism and socialism is just a piss up for wannabee nogoodniks have no masters mind you i like the way free market capitalism is the desired goal when they have all the means to growthits like saying its my ball and you can only play if you let me win in a round about way of course
the wisest political leader in the world
bet davos elites werent expecting that speechgod bless you milei
gdp gdp gdp gdp gdp  not a measurement of human happiness its lifted 1 to extreme wealth
no money is the answer because it has never been tested elites tell you the opposite into oblivion yours
hes conveniantly not addressing that the nongovernment side of the market is corrupt aswell  collusion lack of competition through mergers and takeovers bribes artificial and real costs to entry distort the market  without proper regulation captialisim is in danger of reverting to aristocracy or oligarchy which will result in poverty for many  tax havens and economic structures that provide unfair advantage to some also damage the economic growth  argentina is not a good example due to the corruption in its elites  one could argue that narco states are truely captialist  is that good for society  tell the whole story  not just what you want to see
damn apart from the wef actually letting him speak i can barely believe the ai did such a good job in converting his voice and lip movements to english thats crazy
ridiculous  this guy has no reality
brilliant show it to those ignorant people
what an amazing man he is truly a leader for his people
invest in argentina
this is spot on
this guy gets it
appreciate this
god bless this man
we wiil see the results of his project for argentina in 23 years
as an american this is the first time in my life that a politician has spoken to my values i wish the usa had leadership like this
the wef must fall
i just hope he doesnt end up like jfk or martin luther king god protect him
this man needs to be protected for real

if he is speaking in spanish why are his lips synchronised with the english translation
capitalism must be seen simply as the horse pulling the wagen but the driver must be someone else who fully understands that the world the universe belongs to every human being and that they deserve the right to live the  best as possible in respect whith nature and biodiversity wich are a precious gift that must be preserved
great coverage on this subject that needs more positive attention this is so controversial because the people who hate capitalism do so as they protest in their nike sneakers posting stupidity on tictoks on thier iphones and drinking their starbucks all this while not going to their university classes that capitalists pay for lets get back to no handouts working for what you need and want  providing quality goods and services for a modest price the welfare system made socialism look desirable because welfaresocialism you can do bare minimum yet you get the same things and amounts as everyone gets they fail to realized that welsocial means the govt owns you there will be no nike sneakers for the average citizen  you will wear buddies like jail shoes have the same clothing  sleep on itchy sheets you will stand in line where and when they tell you to for your weekly bread milk cheese and maybe a meat  there will be no handouts in socialism  and socialism will kill  all middleclass  the financial elites will remain elites and everyone below them will be in severe poverty you will work or die work till you die  no financial freedom  no freedom  no voice it will not be the hunger games or  handmaids tail it will be much worse and there will be no heros there will be no resistance
extreme common sense which means no one at the wef will understand it
sounds like atlas wont be shrugging in argentina well done sir i look forward to watching the future prosperity equality and social well being of argentina
klaus would be shocked to hear thison his wef platformbravo argentina
beautiful
great job 
its just a speech i want to see action nothing is changing for the better im done with politics its rat poison for beings with a mind body and soul
brilliant  lets watch argentinas development under his control
speak the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth this is exactly what this man did
an eloquent defense against socialism and centralized control
100  correct
milei is simply brilliant not only because of what he says but also because of where and when he delivers this great speech of a century bravo standing ovation
sadist rule davos  they want poverty
great speech  i am on his side  but there are some mighty presumptions about the human condition in there and although i find it far less idealistic than your average liberalcommunist tripe he is still a politician and he is still describing his side of the argument  but good on him because capitalism is the best we have found so far
someone once said  it is better to live a day as a lion than a thousand years as a sheep
we have survived being together being social human beings capitalism is a parasitic system which exists at the expence of the others monopoly  colony capitalitsts mail goal is profit but not the quality of the products i am totally disagree with his statemets
bravo
this is all good but they already put the plan in motion they wont change itwe are all headed towards enslavement worse than we already arewage enslavement is no better than traditional enslavementevery regular working person in america is a slave work paycheck to paycheck with no end in sightmy generation will never be able to buy houses like they did in the 1950s and the elite class wants it that way if they didnt why has no policy benefited the bottom 70 percent at the expense of the top 1 percent
absolutely fantastic speech 
hes just controlled opposition just from when he says 1240 its a mistake to implement regulations on and dismantle monopolies i can tell you that he is literally speaking at a place full of cronies and ceos of massive monopoliescompanies
unfortunately he is talking to narcissists they dont care hes great historic speech
i am afraid the brave and honest mr milei will never be invited again to this nest of the world worst enemies  wef
no point being rich if our existence is threatened by the thing that made us rich socialism and capitalism are not the answers we need a 3rd way
i was shocked they allowed him to speak so at first thought it was fake but he speaks for everyone imo who still lives by common sense and unwavering morals 
smart people stand above the contradiction while unsmart people stand on one side of the contradiction
does this guy look like benny hill or what
you go boy love this guy
i am happy you sent this we all need to speak out and fight for freedom
the state is not the solution the state is the problem itself sad fact denmark was the first country to sign with wefs plans and that why denmark as we knew it is gone since the signing the political insanity is through the roof sadly because when you think back it was such a nice country klaus was right we definitely need a reset but not his idea of a reset
free argentina
finally someone brave enough to tell the truth bless him
hooray  hope more voters hear this
this is ai people javier has a mole on his right bottom lipchin that mouth is ai generated
this is ai
wow   this is seriously impressive
if i owned a business i would be relocating to argentina immediately
fantastic  at last someone who finally understands economysouth african anc socialist economic policy proves milei is 100 correct  in 1994 onlty 145 or 55m of the country was living in poverty 30 years latter the anc has pushed 65 or 40m citizens into poverty through their misgiuded socialist policies  the anc monthly grants of 305 to 20m is so borderline as by issuing this minimum livable grant they hold those grant recipients on the poverty line indefinatly
absolutely amazing
the guy doesnt even speak english
bravo bravo bravo down with the corrupt wef they do not speak for the people
ai
not as eloquent as ayn rand although the accent is somewhat similar  its going to be an interesting experiment all economists are eager to see the result
exactly whats going on in france  high taxes better to be poor using money from tax payers socialism bureaucrats power more and more control
english is not his first language but at least he spoke in sentences how many post office executives can do that
wonder why he did not join brics and pegged to use usd and create inflation smart guy but whats his motive to hv knowledge but actions are different
this is the man we should have more of
clocked this was fake after about 20 seconds but shows you how good fakes have got and this is just the tip of the iceberg
the state can never be the solution the state is the problem itself  love his true words 
good speech but socialists here in the eu dont respect economic freedom they want us to be dependent on state welfare
this guy is not considering climate change it changed all the paradigm
they dont make them like this man anymore  just think about what may happen to him for this speech and then pray pray pray for him
i did not know he spoke english but he is 100 correct about the wef and glad he at least got to speak up for people as most people are unaware of the evil  that is surrounding us all
the ai seems to be operating his lips too
he spoke the truth sadly today the western world has been highjacked by the neocon globalist few to fuel their endless greed
the audience is thinking yeah argentina failed because they did it wrong it wasnt real communism or how did this dude get here
my favorite speech of all time excellent speech president milei its like david versus goliath
superb i imagine in the original spanish its even more beautiful but i very much enjoyed the listen its great to see a leader speak so passionately about the benefits of liberty and capitalism i hope it works out for argentina and ultimately continues to work out well for the rest of us
about time some brave sould stood up to the davos elites
this man is very brave and hes a political sage to say the least extremely well read and highly knowledgeable we are with you milei love from 
all pretty obvious stuff its a shame it has to be stated in this way of course capitalism or free market economics works best when people have the choice of whether they should buy something or not it starts to break down when services are essential for survival and people have to buy governments can try and enforce competition in such circumstances however governments are too easy to corrupt there is also a temptation to impose price controls which is always a bad idea
the same people that have always had the wealth in the past have the wealth now they will never relinquish their power and the type of politics doesnt matter they control dictatorships and so called democracies alike  the issue is that the wealthy take advantage of all below them whether we have a better quality of life than someone else from somewhere else or another time we certainly have gone backwards in recent times it could be communism or capitalism we are effectively slaves either way  just with different comfort levels due to different rewards and with those rewards comes tax so they take it back from us and mortgages where banks drive the market and inflation the same people are behind either government they dont care how they run the prisonasylum as long as it works for them we the people the masses should be demanding fairness in whatever system you think we need we dont need anything they offer as we need to control our own lives our own households our own communities our own businesses our own finances our countries there is a way out but people have to realise what it is we are already in before that can happen
its really obvious that there are many sentences cut short or totally edited from of his speech and i detest it when editors do that omitting content and stitching different words together ends up relaying something totally different than what was actually spoken msm is really good at that and i would hate to think private media channels do the same 
whether or not you agree with him this speech is one of the most important speeches in decades
thats one surefire bombshell against globalism
this looks  sounds like a fake video  why
theyll use weather as a weapon against argentina what do you think
wow
time to invest in argentina
wealth acquired from exploiting the assets of the weak his argument is based on a false historic premises
willingly forgetting about operation condor another clown sock puppet installed by vested interests telling everyone that nothing works unless the vast majority of a nations resources are stolen by american backed corporations
praise god sir for your vision
who used ai to manipulate his speech from spanish to english and his mouth movements i watched the original he was speaking spanish ai is the worst thing that will ever have happened to humanity  just watch
this bloke is an absolute hero we need leaders like him in the uk now rather than the university indoctrinated marxists who are destroying everything
milei the puppet of the usa and the one who is selling argentina to multinational corporations for a handshake
it is about time the silent majority raise their voices and clearly say to all governments big institutions and money wasting ngos no more  well spoken president milei
cant agree more
ai generated
all great on paper and theorys but in practice and reality i point you to nikola tesla on scientific researchall just words in private business thats why its called private
come back over a year to tell us again how great a leader this is
im not buying this you can not disguise an evil agenda behind things that are annoying people if you dont want to be a good shepard that is one thing just know one day you will answer to god
the video is too aggressively cut
god bless this man 
fun fact austin powers is in fact real
my  hero
a great speech
fake again
wow 
you dont really think that in this democracy which is ruled by the mafia services and lodges someone independent can come to power and play against the interests of the abovementioned
it is simple the modern west and now even china they opress and exploit the weak and the fun part they allow it at least the few powerful in those countries countries like venezuela kongo mexico and many more could be strong economies
javier melei doesnt speak english and presumably the translation is ai can farzyness confirm the translation authentic
bravooooo  degage klaus schwab  
now global governments must stop financing the nwo wef and other global organizations that are stealing our funds with the intent of depopulation
what a heroic speech few of them around the world will make it better peaceful healthy place for humanity
wow
simple good old common sense speech how refreshing tired of the socialist separatist gender bs ideologists time to reverse the course back to prosperity of all humans and for once and for all burry marxism
is this genuine
when bad times exist strong men come forward now where are the other strong men mrs thatcher churchill donald trump
wow he said it all in a nutshell  freemarket capitalism without monopolies or government interference brings prosperity and freedom socialism where the state which has a monopoly on violence raises taxes from the people and  uses them to control the people brings poverty and slavery history has proven this over and over again  feudalism which obtained throughout the world for millenia is essentially the same as socialism which is why the oldmoney elites promote socialism lenin and trotsky were funded by wall street and the bank of england the same socalled aristocrats funded mao in china and pol pot in cambodia  today the central banking cabal which controls the money supply in 170 countries promotes socialism because their owners are wouldbe aristocrats who want depopulation global control and a return to the good old days of masters and slaves
he does not conduct his speeches  in english he always speak spanish with interpreter but that is his voice did you use ai to get a sample of his voice and let the ai speak his translated speech in english
i dont get it he left bricks to join the collapsing dollar  corrupt america 
notice it is the capitalists who say you will own nothing and be happy
no it didnt
amazing speech
brillianttruth spoken right here globalist elites must know we against their wicked agenda we know what they up to and its evil stand together smart citizens of this world
there are other ways for economical coercion beside the state media and manipulation a company a of state a buying assets in state b and operating in state b against the interests of the citizens of that b and for the top x of the citizens of state a an international body lending money to state b in order to do infrastructure projects but requiring state b to not subcontract companies b from state b but company a from state a insteadthe last point is key that is by coercion
coercion by ever larger operations distort and limit individual entrepreneurs  by buying them out at an early stage the coperations stiffel the advance of individual companies  and limit wages the use of that power to stop other companies making their works a success is the bigger danger to libertarian ideas and the spread of wealththe more individual  companies the better  they provide employment and help more people out of povertysocialism  and corporate  power without the acknowledgement  of individual rights and a will to spread wealth is a dead end
outstanding 
wow what a speech i agree totally freedom honour honesty integrity and respect for others is the answer people cannot be coerced into doing the right thing we must choose the right
never expected to hear an actual head of state give such a speech hopefully he recognizes that corporations are collectivist state interventions and not free market business structures individual freedom requires individual responsibility and the corporate legal construct obfuscates said responsibility
1813 
wow 100 correct finally someone says what really matters
unfettered capitalism has caused fascism and the destruction of capital and labour in two world wars and a third on its way capitalisms inherit contradictions always lead to a crisis of capital to blame the woes of the world on socialism is a joke as there hasnt been any meaningful socialism or communism practiced on planet earth
slava rossiya
yeessssss i want to start a business that benefits the people of the world or die trying in the us i have conversations about this with at least 2 strangers a day everyones fed up we want to live beside one another
thank you 
he has straw manned collectivism because ai is a disruptive tech to the existing oligarchy if regulated regulated the ai domain poses a threat to existing power structures as asymmetries within markets are addressed the equilibrium of such an unregulated tech will no doubt trend toward some dystopian nightmare of which we become so entrenched there will be no way out dont be fooled this is a misdirection
so this is the guy we pick to lead earth better than the elites we got now
what an outstanding speech time to move to argentina
bravo
commkn sense and good information from a president i forgot that it was possible thank you for not being like the west and perpetuate the woke propaganda mr president although it does seem that for some reason the leaders of the west are destroying their economies deliberately  he does look like he could be the younger brother of austin powers though
based af
wish we had someone like this in australia actually senator roberts is on the right path
he is right 
at approximately the 2 minutes and 35 seconds point in this video youve cut something out  what was it and why  video footage is often cut specifically to alter the context of what the speaker is actually saying to either promote wrong concepts and ideas or to hide something important thus allowing the person altering it to promote their own slant on what the speaker is really saying  it makes it difficult to put faith in the info presented or to trust the individual editing the footage and uploading it
at last a person who is not afraid to tell these elite the truth 
it took me a good couple of minutes to realise that his lips are ai generated and the audio is translated
freedom 
give this man a true nobel peace prize may i vote for his government too
please  pray for  this  man a great leader may god bless  him his family and his  country
trump 2024
everything he is saying here is good excellent enlight of what he has just said at the wefwhy has he decided to take his country out of the brics to align his country with the us dollarthe central bank in argentina is a national bank now he has decided privatise it whyhe is getting rid of a lot of the ministries of government like the ministry for tourism why
excellent and all things included and is truth
all south african anc and eff supporters should watch this
this man is so dangerous god protect argentina and the world
the super rich detest freedom for others  this ayn rand speech falls on deaf ears in davos 
great speech
a bold speech to call out the collectivist global elitebravo
im amazed a so basic discourse it looks like he is trying to indoctrinate children and so many statements that are factually wrong simple clear and wrong
this is best speech of humans history the most important speech of human history this is human for humanity humanityyyyyyyyyy share and like
ohcommon senseimagine that
facepalm the commenters here are just as smart as his voters
i hope they let him live
i am afraid he will not be very popular with the davos leaders though i believe his words were accurate and his predictions feasible true and fair there are some very powerful people who would rather silence him i hope he manages to run his country and prove his speech right
when he was voted in i was concerned by some of the things i heard about him i have revised that opinion
completly free market without protection of local industries protection public and efficient education and healthcare lead to  suicide social troubles and deep unequality usa deeply in debt fully living in private and public debt should be a reminder of how things can be deeply and seriously bad same for eu states current argentina status is bad but collectivism is not the only reason why it failed collectivism can not easily survive in an environment where financial system tries to burn it with fire you can not survive without taking in account the pressure of the outside world the pressure to force the state to sell its resources and a part of its public resourcesfinancial capitalist system is deeply flawed corrupted and a lot of people denies it and it will always stay flawed until some things are fixed worldwide wealth redistribution local wealth limitation to stop the influence of rich peoples over countries stop corruption minimal protection of local industries minimal local wages for every worker maximal mandatory age for worker which is currently rising because of debt and tax rates guaranteed basic education and healthcare
fantastic speech man speaks truth americans will be moving to argentina
hear hear
he must have been asleep in 2008
sit down klaus class is in session
not so sure about that peaceful part  but most everything else i can agree
what an amazing speech in an environment where most would not dare seak up its a speech i shall listen to many times and refer to frequently what an arrival on the political scene this man has had lets hope the others such as hungary poland  the netherlands can support him and that trump joins the ranks in nov what a breath of fresh air this man truly is
wow  what a fantastic speech  wonder which governments listened  or in some cases understood
damn 
i would not trust anything coming out of the mouth of any wef member
sounds like a good time to move to argentina
thats fine  i ask you this how many lives lost for wealth is acceptable  and how many should hold this so called wealth in capitalism   i dont  take that comparison from past to now  the now is unrecognisable to our past  in knowledge and technology  and the gdp is not a measure of citizen wealth or health  for the same fact you can have a high gdp and yet have the people living in poverty 
i bet ursula bursted in flames
just wait and see how he destroys argentina
wait capitalism was good for wealth but the cost is the destruction of our environments and extreme inequality which is what were trying to rid of no
hes wrong capitalism and consumerism are the backbone of the modern slave society and liberty has to be given freedom is inherent  there is no sensible position  unless you are in the 1  for anything other than hard left accelerationism
bravo sir keep going and ignore these woke morons focused on money money and more money much respect and admiration
implemented socialism leads to poverty word
yeah this should be ai translated in to every language havent seen this even covered in the mainstreet media
this wasnt a speach as much as it was a life lesson in politics and he has all the receipts hopefully a good percentage of attendees return home with an adjusted outlook 
brilliant sales pitch mr president invest in argentina the next great and only nonwoke superpower
maybe someone from this crowd can answer just one question for me is it outside the scope of reason to think that the main difference between the right and the left by todays understanding is that the left is the party where with very rare exception sociopaths seem to go  i mean if you understand sociopathy 200000 new cases diagnosed each year in the us alone and you also believe this man is a truth teller am i missing something  if this is true even a little bit the fight is not political but rather psychological  between people with a condition that can not be cured and those who frankly want to be left alone  seems rather  well yeah
my god keep him safe
a
thank you for being bold brave
wef if pure evil
are they listening at davos
r williams voice
im sure he wont get an invite back for next years meeting
ai make it beautiful   so clear its like he speaks english perfect
what an absolute legend javier is one of my favorite ppl on earth
you arent going to hear any applause from that crowd for javier5 milei  hes now a hated man by globalists joining the ranks of president trump
ok good words lets see his doings
soros and globalists hate this man for pointing out how theyre trying to control the world
i dont know what they are doing yet and i always know they are playing us they are allowing a revolution on purpose but why maybe because instead of this one world government completely ruining our lives they come in as the heroes fix everything and then you take the mark but first the christians disappear then chaos then solution they turn on everyone on the 3rd year
wowthank you president milai your speech illuminated the most important fundamentals of a successful society which are currently being dismantled and destroyed by those psychopaths whose power and wealth are achieved through wars corruption and premeditated murderwe all need to stand together and peacefully refuse to comply with these despotslong live free market capitalism 
subsidy capitalism such as wind power solar panels batteries hydrogen etc leading us to poverty
im glad this is being said around the world and not just inside the us where you will be silenced by media lies or even actual deathwhich is why a lot of people do not say what needs to be said or do what needs to be done finally
they had him speak at davos folks we are winning
the people of argentina are lucky to have him hes going end poverty in his country  argentina found their version of president trump
in my opinion he is totally right
it doesnt matter the politicaleconomical school of thought socialism and capitalism are equally doomed to fail when in the hands of corrupt people
what a bullshit
the only part i dont agree with is that monopolys should be allowed to exist competition must be a prerequisite for a functioning free market
shame on you for censoring this speech for muh demonatization censoring this for your own monetary gain shameful
i love ludwig von moses and wish argentina good luck and prosperity for the future
put a cap on personal wealth and personal assets the excess goes to the betterment of the entire country
couldnt even listen to the crap that was coming out of his mouth after a while
well done libertad carajoo freedom dammit
this man is rightspot on
argentina didnt go down due to socialism but because of corruption what milei is saying is lets grow despite the environmental consequences and he forgets to mention that the best countries in the world are social democracies
this is ai generated melie didnt do his speech in english  fact
bravo
collectivism communism thats collective farms gulagswelcome to nwo 1984 is back
i just want to move to argentina  we need leaders like this
we are all forced coered to pay taxes
right growth at what cost  this is a shallow speech growth at the cost of destruction of our planet there needs to be a balance natural growth  that growth lead to the situation we are now since we no one can grow forever now the despair and greed of those who grew the most are trying to control through a fake socialism   there needs to be balance a dialog with the people and the different ideas leaders have a grown up world
sounds like canada more tax
he says there are no market failures it depends what he means by market failures some people say things like it was a failure of the market to deal with such and such a social issue for example if someone is born without property in a country where education is not free then the market will not be a successful medium to guarantee equality of opportunity not outcome and of course the problem with capitalism as a historical system is that it evolved out of the aristocratic relations of europe wherein a segment of the population began from year 1 with great swathes of property and others were simultaneously disenfranchised through enclosure and sent to factories where the wages were not enough to build up any stable capital if you continue forward through that story democracy was only achieved at the beginning of the 20th century after which time there were two catastrophic wars which reduced most of the continent to poverty and they have only been climbing out of that state since contrary to what president milei says standard of living has been dropping in the west since the 1970s when calculated by purchasing power of the general populationi did not write the above to advocate socialism or to claim that i have debunked the above speech but only to point out a problem i do not understand why many in this comment section see this speech as being radical since it represents the ideas of the political mainstream since at least the 1980s every western country operates on a capitalist basis even the social democratic ones which are not run through government planning but only differ through higher tax regimes and government spending not in the operation of the market which are all open to competition and there are no countries with completely unregulated markets and i doubt there ever will be because that would mean among other things allowing poisons into everyday products
we need you in spain
if you were in the uk i would vote for you
amen wicked world
looks like ai generated and sounds like it too
all problems stem from lack of accountability
theres a hidden variable here fossil fuels fossil fuels have fuelled this enormous growth bubble but they are a limited resource each barrel of oil contains about four years of labor for a human in terms of energy there are very obvious externalities to our use of fossil fuels and other limited natural resources and we are wreaking havoc on our world by the narrow focud on gdp please have a look at the great simplification podcast with energy researcher nate hagens to get a better understanding of where we are and where we are headed
is it ai why does it sounds so monotone
id invest in argentina if they switched to a free market capitalist economic system id be happy to buy stock in argentina 
bravo bravo congratulations excellent hope world changes for peace and love and happiness for all may god help us
argentina president  javier milei 
this fantastic man speaking the truth has been elected by the people in contrary to the klausi and leyen clowns
it is a crime shame  world  leaders  have no solution no strong solution insolving just a  bunch of waste  talk
dont be fooled its aigenerated sure its him but translated with a fake accent he gave the speech in spanish
very good well worth time to listen effort to understand  hope  prayers for those in power to redirect current political course for the well being of all also president trump i am certain would support this history of reality as well as a future direction for the us
remember the plan is to be so totally bloody terrible in order that the not so bloody awful alternative but still terrible they present looks a little bit appealing in comparison
this guy is 100 right on
this man is not suicidal this is passion for a better way then wage slavery
empty
they discovered this is a deep fake
disgusting
boom
the false dichotomy of capitalism and socialism  irrespective of what political system unless you are america that issues us dollar if a counry like argentia consistently have higher government spending than tax revenue and must print more money to pay off international debt that result in very high inflation for decades and consistently default its own debt  then your country would be dysfunctional     it s like blaming economic mismanagement of argentina  to democracy because voters want to keep government subsides and keep electing politicians that overspend and default its debt socialist china uses capitalism to list its own stateowned enterprises to market local governments hired venture capitalists to invest and use investment gains to subsidise health care and education  socialism works when a country is spending within its means and it uses capitalism as a tool to raise more tax revenue not overspend or borrow just to win elections
an exceptional new elected president that may change the narrow minded state people live in
monopolism doesnt contribute to economic growth
god protect this manargentina will thrive and the rest of the world will have to make a choice 
this speech had to be translated and shared around the world 
thank  you president milei    support trump as he does you
why is this audio edited  shame on you
how is it the liberals cant understand this concept
until we realize we need each other for life to work these ideas are wrong for the human being on this planet i find it interesting really we all are here alive and we just cant seem to realize we are one big living thing on this planet and it is truly an amazing time to be on this planet with so much abundance the waste we produce if realized would hurt the feelings so few beyond the human life worth wealth that would save poverty stricken nations and so many making that wealth actually happen we must solve our problems and realize we need each for any of this life stuff to work even me using this platform trying to say something to you who is really me i must solve my own problems
he misses a very important issue before the industrial revolution only a very very few were part of the capitalist system most were not part of it the huge difference is the creation of democracy where all people could be part of the capitalist system and regulation so those that have most power cannot abuse those with no power i think it was henry ford said that my workers should earn enough to be able to by my product this contributed more than anything to the economical uprise of the american economy before that the vast majority were so poor that ot was not sure if they could eat every day  in a capital system
are we just going to gloss over the fact this speech was given in spanish and then ai translated and reperformed the speech in english incredible
bro did ai also do lip sync on the video
the question is  are the elites who hold the wellbeing of the humanity in their hands and their pocket books even listen do they even care  it seems more like they are manoeuvring to ensure in the next epoch that they and theirs will maintain hegemony over those they deem to be lesser than they see themselves
wow absolutely  fucked the elite law makers of the western  world wonder how imf and world bank leaders must be feeling  now when the truth is spoken in such eventgo argentina go so the west
cool use of ai  translations
does anyone else notice the abrupt shifts in his movements this almost looks like its ai generated
superb thanks farzad for providing this presentation
hey its were going to one world and globalism i want him to be the president
he starts by saying we the western world never knew argentina was a western nation 
i dont disagree the only limit we have as celestial elements is thinking that we have limits liberty crusader
we live in fantastic abundance
amen to the president of argentina
yall do realize he is saying this on a stage with the letters wef behind him right nobody aligned with the wef has your best interest in mind he is a plant
wow  what a great speech  i agree with him and i live in new zealand
this appears to be extremely and heavily did and i dont believe this gentleman was that fluent in english from the interviews i have heard previously this is awesome i would prefer to hear the unedited version if one exists
capitalism requires collective expense for individual profit in other words as long as the averages work out alright it all alright nonsense capitalists have gladly exploited undeveloped countries leaving only poverty where socialists can move in with easy promises that they have no way of fulfilling only thus guy to say it is all for the collective bestnonsense
this man is a hero
 bravo 
good man a patriot
did they deep fake the lips he gave the speech in spanish
god bless that man he said to there faces yes
putin gave a similar speach and they took him to war
he should go to davos to attend world economic forum and tell them all that open eyes to face true
the greatest speech of the last 50 years i hope this speech can inspire others to take up the fight against the hidden socialist agenda that is destroying western society and to give this speech in the during the wef shows he has no fear nor should others 
this smells like ai
i wanted to like this video but i accidentally voted for him instead
hes cool
fascist regime under disguise watch the accelerated demise of argentina these opportunistics emerge in desparate times and take advantage of the situation and make it worse you will see for proper sources of information look to noam chomsky and find independent news so that you may see things for what they are not as what the puppet masters would like to convince you to see this milei is a puppet and a obedient one at that
same in poland goverment want to control us in all aspects increased taxes and giving money to people doing nothing biurocrasy is unbelievable high restricting our work in private sector tax office control yr bank accounts asking questions from where we have money full control we are slaves in such circumstances we will not achieve progress we will go down and sink
an argentinian that moved from argentina because of the left mindset he put it completely right now many western countries are falling because left ideas it is refreshing to know that argentina has waking up and understand who the enemy is
ive never in my life seen a president with such an indepth knowledge of economics and free market capitalismthis gives me hope for the future i cant believe he pulled this off at the globalistsocialist world economic forum
ok let s see the  el loco and what he is going to achieve for argentina
my internet seems to be working just fine tho
if we werent so old in our 80s  we would be  wanting to move to argentina javier milei is a godsend  come on world find someone like him in every country and save our children grandchildren and great grandchildren from the greedy monsters who will impoverish them if we allow it
do you think barrack and joe are listening  
finally someone stands up speaks out against the new massive coming back of the old dirty roten communism
makes perfect sense to me
he is amazing
can someone speaking spanish confirm that what has been interpreted to english matches the original and this is not another fake
respect  muito bem dito era favor de educare aqueles cachorros que se chamao governadores de portugal   parab√™ms
he just signed his life sentence all great mavericks are taken down by the socialist regime of the world
such a brave man
klaus is asking who the fck let this guy in
more please
if president milei could run for us president id vote for him
its going to shock a lot of people but the wef are not communists they want you consoooming
get that man a beer
bravo bravo 
i am behind javier respect from america
about time a man stood up and spoke the truth take my hat off to this man
this video has been altered and changed from its original i dont trust it
truth and logic how refreshing
why do i think this will upset klaus and the wef so much they will unleash a global cyber attack you do know klaus has already said this will happen hold on right people
yeah rock on brother well said the truth well delivered
bravo
economic freedom private property rights free competitioncapitalism not coerced taxation socialism  so called social justice and equity state intervention and the monopoly of violence
great presentation but corruption the mic and the lust for power will doom america
i bet this guy knows how to balance a budget an economists and businessman not a lawyer
milei is a true hero
hallelujah
my respect for javier mille is now 2nd to none in the western world of government leaders the man completely gets it
wow   just wow
he literally  spoke about  everything the wef stands for  which is not good  he got a little applause also  makes one wonder if half those people sitting there even knows what the wef is all about
his speech is unique courageous and one of the most important of our time believe it western civilization is at the brink of colapse not far from now not in a distant future its already happening lets give this brave good mans speech a lucid leader the praise it deserves share it incessantly and start giving it a real purpose in our lives not just at social media be prepared to reinforce your core values ethics and morals we need it as the air we breath if we want to survive and not be subdued for the rest of ours and next generations lives
wow great speech sir
first of all why are we being told to be  respectful by youtubeits all just so strange i think we can all think and speak for ourselves i never get reminded to be respectful when im watching a cooking channelwho are we worrrie will be offendedwe all know the truth no matter what the who or the  wef says and does which is more than offensivewe the people are free because christ jesus has set us freewe do not fear man but god alonewe bow the knee to the righteous judge and creator of this world who was and is and is to come jesus is lordfight and speak up for truth no matter the cost
lol what an ideologue  completely overlooks the quality of lives in australia  new zealand the nordic countries germany etc etc etc australia for example has the best quality of life in the world they have a mixed social democracy with socialised medicine housing and many many many many other government interventionist policies that right wing ideologues would consider socialism and why are countries like america that has more free market policies have some of the highest incarceration rates the poor have very limited access to health violent crime is high basically every metric that provides quality of life for the vulnerable and poor is at its worst in america poor countries like russia have better stats than america in this regard but right wing ideologues like this dont contend with any of this shit or worse they dont know it exists
its nice to see an adult in the room bravo sir
what a fucking hero
awesome all around go argentina
dang you go dude
the globalist dont want growth they want control wealth and freedom for themselves only
why is it edited and cut  so much
long live freedom damn it god bless him and argentina
it is edited badly makes it seem fake
protect this man
robbing taxes we feel 
it sound like a robot
respect to this leader from australia  bravo and good luck
nazism marxism and islamism are all failed ideologies
i would like to think that the true enemy here is not capitalism per se but the usurpation of the free market by corporate powers creating monopolies of one or more corporations and suppressing entrepreneurs and or products which endanger corporate profits
well i dont think the dictatorship wef was to happy to hear his speach
we need one of him in australia hope our politicians have watch this
collectivism keeps things static and suppresses innovation  it benefits the ruling classes
one of the best speech in history
i maybe looking to move some of the nicest guys i knew growing up were argentine
capitalism makes the assumption that the pursuit of money is the healthiest option availableim not saying it is or isnt just that it makes me want to look at alternative hybrid options to see if we might find something that is more important to pursue than money
i want to move to argentina
viva la libertad carajo zurdos afuera
wonderful speech all true powerfully delivered i can only hope that america is listening
giga chad
amazing english hes such an articulated speaker great leader the argentine people chose bravo to them
awesome go freedom go milei
f the wef
why so many skips like edit points when you edit or put clips together
there is hope for all of us
the best speach at the wef forum
amazing  a politician who actually understands wow  how refreshing
he hastened through the regulationportion of his speech because he was so blatantly wrongneither capitalism or socialism are workable in their present application
ai generated speech whats the proof that its not ai
these demogogues were never wellintentioned it was always about their psychotic greed and lust for power
what a load of rubbish who owns the gdp in the usa the free market is subsidised by the tax payer they love this socialism god forbid a sick or starving person is given help lifestyle is the measure not the penury of forced labour due to debt this guy is a conduit for the american capitalist dictatorship that is 34 trillion dollars in debt this debt will be paid by the productive worker not some investor money shuffling and devaluing the cash
awesome thanks for your truth bombs i pray many countries wake up and kick the wef and un out of their countries  amen th k you for your courage
edited by you tube period
bravo  well said
clever chameleon he is one of them doing their bidding he is selling out argentinas national assets to the foreign elites
hes not wrong taxes were started by the romans as a slave control mechanism it worked
ladies and gentlemen you just received a masterclass in american conservative economic system
at 11 minutes i realized he was talking about ny realestate we live in a socialist state 
wow i totally agree with him
ai did this  damn
do you really believe globalists listen this
this guy is reading a prepared speech and never looks up he trots out the usual stuff about socialism india is not socialist it is capitalist and the poverty there is horrendous with 8 year olds employed in dangerous jobs whereas poor little socialist cuba with no intrinsic wealth and sanctioned for 75 years manages to provide free healthcare and education america the gold standard of capitalism has 70 million people without healthcare 87 million people with no money thousands not people sleeping on the streets and a degree costing 100000 dollars of course he wont last
central and south american countries have no one but themselves to blame for their failure they did not suffer from wwi and wwii they all have rich natural resources in comparison european and asian countries survived from two wars and subsequently regional conflicts germany japan south korea rebuilt itself from ruins singapore hong kong taiwan and some southeast asian countries with lack of natural resources have successfully transformed themselves into modern society what argentina has been doing since 1900
nahh mann u guys dont see whats going on  they just used deepfake on us and we accepted it coz its what we want to hear they got us  get ready for a wild ride 
what a great speech  not only in content but in the clarity of its  expression bravo
but eventually a market economy will ultimately conclude with a single company for the entire world which will be walmart or like in ancient times egypt and its pharaohs and the only language well speak will be in hieroglyphs
looks like a benny hill character
i love this leader he has taken argentina back to a free market society valuing all its people and their contributions to society that was what the lord wanted for the world trust god and fight evil and corruption
time to move to argentina 
i couldnt watch the video his voice killed me who put this man on the podium
man did he nail that shit 
i bet klaus schwab shat himself when he heard this brilliant speech
bravo  bravo
now i belive thats a  great speech
i would say animals are smarter than us
amen
19 minutes of confusion
as i keep saying the wef is the evolution of capitalism not socialism theres no such thing as a free market they are opposites diametrically opposed stop defending the status quo this is it the lockdown transfer of wealth wasnt to benefit the poor ps forever worldwide blackout meets cbdc when cash is no more plutocracy and technocracy are doomed pss word of god
he forgot  war  war comes from it also 
legend
sounds alot like reagan circa 1964 will the world listen
such load of bs let see how this clown will reform argentina
want libertylook to argentinanot america
well said
when someone shows up with backbone we sit up and listen
i really like this guy if he can remain safe and healthy throughout his presidency then he may go down in history as one of the true heroes of western civilization
i guess my question is did he really say that you said this is ai translated
he is a hero the extent to which the msm has been corrupted is equal to how much this man and the citizens of argentina have been ignored
telling the truth is rarity now these day take a moment of the life to enjoy the truth
the elites have syphoned enough money to last them lifetimes by rigging the free market system in their favor allowing them to hoard vast sums of money in a zero sum economy  they broke the system and now believe its up to them to fix it
wow 
this is how normal thinking people in the west feel we arent happy with what our government has done and how its treated other countries and its people
i thank this man  the us is turning into a disaster  using the fed to regulate markets has been a mistake since the obama adm  opening our borders is also a disaster along with cancel culture which is a communist and fascist ploy
im currently trying to escape america idk where to go with no passport on hand and i dont even want to be a citizen of america anymore
brilliant
god demonstrates his own love for us in this while we were still sinners christ died for us romans 58 jesus died for you believe and repent of your sin if you die without jesus son of god it will be too late there will be no excuses  they will say peace and safety in the end 1 thessalonians 53
paid mouth for billionaires
beautifulabsolutely beautiful
dont worry gods still in control i know your thinking it seems like gods asleep up there hes not all the informatin you need is written in the instructin manual better know as the bible things are going to get a lot worse you see if everyday at some point the fix it man the antichrist will come in and give the appearance of rescuing the world its all a lie the antichrist will demand you worship him as god if you refuse and declare christianitywell you can read about it in revelation 204
outstanding speech
oscar winner bravo
it doesnt matter how much you produce it matters how much you retain from that how much you can use
why is this man not leading davos
what a smart wise argentine leader 
hes a true capitalist ted kazinski would love to meet this guy did this guy mean providing all capitalist fat pockets a safe haven in argentina by  saying you have argentina as allies  is this forum a marketing campaign to generate wealth like dubai afterall everybody joking for themselfs
god bless this man
hero in my book
one of the most important speeches of recent times it parallels trumps 2016 speech detailing the plan to remove the corrupt deep state and all involved both talks provide solutions to our recovery
the united states has moved deep into socialism by deeming certain groups a protected class at the expense of other groups this protected class claiming oppression is above the law where others are ruled by it they use this advantage to avoid being responsible and through lawyers  extort money and destroy the reputations of others america is not moving toward socialism it is moving toward totalitarian authority who acquires power by claiming the need to protect groups of people based on superficial characteristics and a past history if america does not return to equal justice for all it is doomed as a country
thank god for this man
bravo happy to have heard this speech today thank you for the upload
why cant we have a president like this in the us biden is a stooge for china
its a ray of sunshine to see an intelligent man like this offer the world another way than the likes of the globalist
question a banana peel if oxn was to slxp on it
well said 
funny thing is the nazis hes talking to are implementing collectivism he doesnt understand while slurping klauss value roaches i guess
outstanding
wish we had this guy as our president instead of our guy policies like our guy created argentinas devastation and i think this guys policies will reverse thst problem is the imfs head is in the room and could make it hard on this guys plans
i never thought in my lifetime i would have to hear a head of state try to convince the world economic forum that capitalism is the best model for wealth creation and long term growth what on earth happened 
excellent speech of facts with real results to back it up
wow ai translation does impressive job
finally good show argentina
moralizing accent now thats a president
watch out for flying bullets javier luv ya baby
common sense fantastic speech
ai
preach
i wish i could vote for him
how long before milei starts selling its citizens as slaves
thank god for him 
i have not heard more bullshit claims and farfetched arguments in a long time
lolthis guy has argentina in ruins
better have some good bodyguards
whoa  give this man a hand
this man aint no simp
power to the good and honest people
this guy is a hero a capitalist much like trump 
jesus lead socialism is the only way
corporatismnounthe control of a state or organization by large interest groupsroughly one hundred years ago the free market began to be replaced with corporatism
well said sir standing up to the evils of the wef and giving the free world hope
the more poor we get and the less freedom we have slavery
the wef sucks
well said javier milei
finally somebody on the wef stage who isnt antihuman
pass out the transcript to every human on earth
sir your words must be transmitted across the world to inspire the people to gain back their freedom from the evil  insidious intrusion of our central governments  please let us  know how we can stand behind and aid you to spread these precious words
amazing truth am wondering why wef  allowed this part of the manipulation
klaus schwab could learn english from him
read his lips  he is clearly speaking english  where is the ai translation
im sure everyone in the room gave him a huge standing ovation after that
so well said that he has earned the highest respect i have ever offered
milei has balls of steel to make this speach  but the wizards of the world economic forum already know all this but they dont want us prosperous free or to own anything
shout out to the translator he did an amazing job
if only every country had a leader like him
the main point here is that corruption and collusion is the poison in the system
so balance socialism with capitalism australia is a successful example
people dont like to hear the truth they like orators like barack hussain obama who speaks very confidently  but says nothing
free market capitalism is the cure for poverty only the lazy remain in the poverty they have earned those who that work rise out of poverty
the world economic forums wants everyone to be homosexual vegetarian poor and alone without children
he is very interesting
wow people are impressed by some guy presenting economic fascism
many blessings for this brave man to speak the truth
bravo   trump 2024
joker
well done so proud javier milei
the danger of the socialism of the rich
wow
hottake the military uses a socialistic payment systemso do roads
you are all greatly missing the point the state is the extension of the corporations not the other way around government doesnt control the economy the capitalist control the government
this is a once and a century speech straight to the core of all the true issues facing this world well said
well done m√≠lei 
we have all the technology and ability to make it a better world we just need to do it and make it widespread squander your greed in the fact you will never leave this planet it is the only planet like it the current known universe even if we found another one that is a generational and theoretical journey the developing nations are creating huge amounts of emissions developed countries have the means to employ converters of sorts capitalism can be coupled with the foundations of a steward with that said we should always try to have the lowest impact on our precious environment or were all in trouble
california is socialist
trump 2024   i hope he has the balls like this guy f the wef
thank you sir
with the skipping video and weird mouth movements it really seems like an ai video
in other words come bring your companies to argentina and ill show you capitalist ideas argentina first and bring your money why not just keep it for your people and dont go down the american road as they the super rich will run your country and you will be corrupted  
i havent heard someone drop so many truth bombs in my life so amazing to hear the truth for a change were all drowning in propaganda here in the west wake up
now this is a president people can get behind well said
this is brilliantfuk the american deep state an legacy media  power in numbers an power to the people revolutionary
imagine freedom not for america
he is basically calling for globalism lite  when he says collectivism he actually means nationalism  they would not let someone on to push against globalism
look at china socialisms great success story look at the us capitalism decline collapsing economy by huge loans
this guy is completely brainwashed by cpitlism propaganda
up nice
is argentina president helping wef from a different angle tear down current infrastructures to replace with globalist communism bitcoin blackrocks bitcoin eft is an attempt to control bitcoin can any one see this
absolutely awesome listen to every word he has said
this man understands what makes the world working and everything he said are proven facts argentina is lucky to have this man today as leader i hope the other leaders of the western world listened to this speech and took some notes
maga make argentina great again this is the guy if you dont wake up you will starve or be enslaved freedom damn it
if you can conceptualize this truth act upon it live it share it then we will all be better for it and never to be put down     
the schooling of those ambitious globalista gathered above the swiss clouds up in davos by this argentine leader of real facts so plainly stated is a real joy for fellow libertarians worldwide
i pray for gods protection for this man
this guy is what we need more of in the world
long live freedom dammit
this guy has no clue and attracts people like him
always sounds great from a nazi perspective but for a free worldwatch out
wonderful
i like this guy 
socialism is condemning people to poverty  what a great mantra that should become for freedom
his speech is the opposite of wef plan
what made all this happen slavery wow
love how some pieces are redacted and cut out of the original video
sorry but true socialists wont be convinced that capitalism is not the roof of evil of all our problems by one single speech
wont be seeing this on the bbc
he is one of them such disappointment
this is ify thats the understanding of this this cant be trusted thats the understanding of this anything connected with the wef from now on should be doubted they can not be trusted so they try to draw us in with sensible reason after so many years of obvious nonsense do not trust them hopefully that is enough said thank you
this guy speaks the facts instead of the fiction the wef is pushing
vamos argentina carajo 
the best and maybe most important speech by a politician in the history of speeches by politicians nothing sensational nothing to rouse emotions just straight facts and warnings and encouragements cant believe he got into that room
as a us citizen born and raised here the world should know that our voices are getting suppressed in the mainstream media believe me we are very aware of what is going on we also know that civil war is something we do not want we do not want to truly exercise our 2nd amendment the cost of doing so will be painful as the largest standing free army in the world the american people fight it would be brutal we are holding on to peace as long as we can at the expense of abuses by our government that has been compromised by globalist we act in defense of our families against evil good will bear the burden of sacrifice and if it is gods will that we do so shall it be if the us citizen fights the globalist the world will know it 
this guy is so truthful that it is scary
ole
spot on  bet they were fuming  speaking truth 
collectivists are communists
im truly intrigued about the mans education he knows some solid free market economic fundamentals and can also clearly define the myriad faults of collectivism that the fascists at wef even let him on the property after all hes said publicly is a shocker i wish him well
just drop that mic brother great job they know we know they are about to get slammed with reality
its tough to tough translation vis ai this could just be a deep fake
how about living the collective every lifetime ive evolved through since my beginning there been nothing else in physical dominant earth and there will be nothing else in spiritual positive earth we must write perfect soul on the earth  all of us this is how we earn our immortality god is elevating matter and closing out death we manifest our manifestation im at personal business and personal opinion these people are trying to shove their opinion down our throat i got the quality i carry maternal  thats their problem they walked the lie
so unfettered growth will continue no other system works this way so why should capitalism do it
dont forget that monopolies can also be a menace to the free market as well
truth interpreted becomes reality  however every individual has his own reality which is dependant upon the lenses which hes looking through  argentinas socialist experience is not the same as that experienced by china obviously any sweeping statements about one or the other is therefore neither correct not relevant
truest
so glad smart people still exist and he showed right down their globalist throats bravo milei
outstanding speech i hope all the american people are watching this president biden is destroying the united states of america
right on in their faces
milei 100
here here we need more leaders like this
deep fake this is ai generatedthis is not realits true its right but someone faked this with ai
the guy is nwo puppet
great people create great president
why he went alone there   its danger these people replace the original with clones and send them back home even his family members wont realize the clone then he obey the order remember what happened to pope 
the top 1 would like to thank javier for his service
having the balls to tell many of these elites the simple truth  straight to their faces   many will nod and pretend to degree bc at their core they pretend to care about the collective and their companies andor countries but really only care about themselves
the truth will reign thank you javier milei 
americas discovery
controlled opposition enough said
maybe we should all move to argentina itll be the next america
we defend palestine
thank god for this man and all the people who are listening
if current peaceful economically successful nations speakout im all ears  not so much for argentina  what do they have to say about how to create a great country in finland denmark sweden netherlands and canada
excellent
making argentina great again 
ahhh javier i truly cheer you words but authoritarian socialism follows years of successful capitalism some in capitalism get stupid rich but this wealth is not enough they look around and see that the masses have escaped poverty and now have money the wealthy covet this wealth and push governments to change policies so they can gain the property of the masses socialism is the way they choose to make the masses poor and enrich themselves thus we have the wef stupid rich who never have enough
wef may take him outthey dont like the truth in a age of universal deciet telling the truth is a revolutionary act
the us shouldve just taken over the world after wwii and brought freedom to every country but in a move completely unprecedented by any known civilization in history we didnt we chose to deal with the consequences instead
this is the smartest man alive 
is this realwould be nicecould be deep fake hope not
absolutely factual and correct
powerful truth
finally  common sense illustrated
wow a politician who speaks to people like he doesnt think they are idiots and fools  how refreshing
we have hope
another trudeau in disguisedwait and see for what he really is
wow wow this guy is the man
every conservative party in the world must revert to classical liberalism in order to survive
this man has done his homework and anyone who challenges him better be damn well prepared
finally a guy with the guts to say what everyone else was thinking this man is truly a hero
interesting that since the advent of a mixed economy in the 1800s were so much better off than before but now he wants to end that 
truer words were never spoken  but will the silly minded radical left listen
looks like someone has shortened their live span
thank you argentina for speaking the truth
you will have nothing und you vill enjoy yourself 
joe biden is a damn socialist sick of this weak ash us president
his iq  10000trump
truth
they are cutting parts out  they dont want everyone to hear how good things used to be  but with socialism its breaking people and killing their country 
okay boss
1112 any market failure would have to be attributed to the corrupt monetary system that creates money from debt and then multiply it by a factor of 10 because any rightminded 6 year old seeking to be fair would notice that theres something inherently wrong with that system unless were all allowed to do it which is not the case because if i do that i go to jailgod grant me patiencebecause if you grant me strength im need bail money too
one of the few in the world to stand up to those clowns at the wef too bad we dont have that kind of leadership in the us government judicial system law enforcement press and religious leaders its not about politics its about a way of lifejavier is my hero
like to big to fail mandates that were imposed on the citizens of the world by plutocrats as a socialist authoritarianism to a free market system that would have allowed the corruption to destroy these corrupt businesses this would have opened up huge opportunities for a better controlled financial system
realty check 
thank you lamb chops for saying what everyone was thinking but no one had the balls to say
this man is a very wise man he is argentinian so he has seen this wef nazi crap before these unelected narcissists have to be put in their place along with the so called governments that are in bed with them
just look at  cuba an absolute vile quality of life not long ago one of the coolest places on the planet
why does the video keep jumping feel like im watch max headroom but the voice isnt matching lol
wow this speech spoke to every thing ive been worried about here in the us since the democrats started destroying what america stands for god bless him and protect him all western nations need to listen to this man
hes a hero to tell the truth
the fog is coming
i like this man and love what he said
to kick inflation to 200 and to make poverty worse in argentina was a great way to start his governmentthe western world is so socialist that 1 has more money than then the rest of the people
will be helpful if he can actually fix argentina before giving a speech like this
i actually stood and applauded  long live captain anarcho god bless argentina
bs speech
this is what a leader looks like  prepared intellectually historically and linguistically such that he can convey and explain the actual problems and causes of the crumbling of western culture unarguably the greatest civilization in the history of the world  hes laid out in a nutshell the issues the backdrop of why we are where we find ourselves and the solution to the slavery we are living every day  its happened so slowly that we never noticed   he makes the current political class appear as mental midgets   long live liberty  argentina is leading the way   shall we followits high time we did
the trueth of what has happened in argentina and every place that has gone down the  socialist path is undeniable what an amazing speach well done that man
ty for truth
i love him  if the nations would just be fair and leave us alone the whole world would be a much better place 
whats with all the fucking jump cuts
i cant figure out how to get past the ads
apple is a partner of the wef if they agree we will own anything and like it we should not buy apple products
did he say cake and icecreamhahaha
can milei also simultaneously be pm of canada
the wef represents the control he speaks against  collusion of states with a  global dictatorship
ayn rand reborn   rare truth spoken in the den of vipers 
oligopoly and monopolies arent part of the free market of competition as time goes on these mega corporations are buying up the small family businesses that should be part of the capitalist market this also is not good for society either if all the money is at the top of a few unless more of this money is filtered back down to society then society will suffer at the hands of the extremely rich
socialism  capitalism
this man spoke truth to power imagine if the wef started preaching and empowering capitalism throughout the world
dont forget arch this version hes cutting off too much audio in order to cut off 10 minutes of time
you wonder why i relate to argentinians its not just because i was born in buenos aires when i was 3 years old its because like he said the past 100 years has been a crazy ride it makes a crazy people and i love crazy 
i really like this guy
wow incredible a sane voice in clown world
i dont have to stick the topic youtube i will discuss any subject or matter as i wish
fake
fake
fake
this video is fake
whats up with all the weird cuts
republicans say ss and medicare are socialism the truth is they are funded by paid in taxes the us giving argentinian  is socialism the united states provided 45 million in assistance to argentina in fy2021 latest comprehensive data available
fun game drink everytime theres an edit or jumpcut youll be dead in 3 minutes
he talks to his electorate onlyhes a petty neoliberal
this was great and really shows that there are some good people all over the world im in the usa and everything this man said was well understood and well put i am jealous of argentina
207 that is 100 correct but i wanted to qualify it in this waywe have never actually experienced free market capitalism and its full potential has never been realized due to the unfortunate fact that its ever present parasitical twin crony capitalism has thus far prevented it from being as effective as it could be so whats being referred to as free market capitalism is actually more like free market capitalism lite from having been hobbled and if we could ever figure out a way to effectively neutralize crony capitalism then free market capitalism would be unleashed to be all that it can be
hitler believed in socialism nazism is national socialism hitler hated capitalism
awhh mann only if a us president can go up there nd talk like this proud of argentina yall got the right one
love this guy
viva milei  viva argentina a modern day throw back to the usa founding fathers superb speech protect this man at all cost
 this is awesome my name is nicholas dappolonia and i approve this message
gotta love this guy
respect 4 this man
this man is amazing could america barrow him for a while
klaus schwab must regret inviting this guy the wef is full of socialistscommunists
capitalismconsumerismoverconsumption corporations convince people that they need things they dont need the ceos make millions while the workers make pennies
hope the irish  government listens to this  leo vradkar michael martin and helen mcentee listen up
right on right on not going to kiss butt to the phonies of the world
god bless this man for speaking the truth
  well said finally someone brave enough  intelligent enough to speak out for what is right for the people of this worldgod bless this man   
long live freedom damn it yes he said that
argentina chose well
the wef doesnt believe in the stuff this guy is saying theres something wrong here
i know someone who moved here from the us maybe he knew something we didnt
he went after feminists
this has to be the best speech i have heard all my life thank you dear mr milei you are making history love from israel
three cheers  hip hip hurray  wow  havent heard anything like that since milton friedman in the 1980s  incidentally it is his chicago boys that went down to chile and implemented free markets that has made chile today the first latin american first world nation in historyit has succeeded enormously every time it has ever been implementedcompared to the over 100 million deaths of socialist utopians and billions who have suffered and died in abject poverty and near starvation  the facts are clear
i voted for him and it was the best decision in my life
finally a president with balls telling truths in the center of hell
finally truth is spoken
and unrestricted respect for private property  except for women then of course their eggs are not their property for some reason so much for libertarianism establishes equality between sexes 
fake
this guy is calling out the wef he will never be invited to speak again
no it didnt just checkedstill works
imagine not knowing this guy is wefapproved proplandemic and completely submitted to the tikkun olam agendanaive children you all are
amen
freedom
first in the 1960s the dependicistas used a limited and biased interpretation of economic history to erect trade barriers and implement unwise industrial policies now over 50 years later economic history is again abused for a subjective political agenda when will wisdom strike
kudos milei
why arent we seeing this speech anywhere
god bless this man  
certainly a intelligent man to elect him congratulations to argentina
love this man
argentina good job this man is bringing painful truth to those that wish it werent so
that ai face is creepy once it literally appeared to slide off his face
the unelected elites want to dictate to us  the serfs how we should live eat and think thank you president melei may you succeed and be protected as you work for freedom small government private property rights and a free market capitalism
i have a new respect for argentina
could be a historical speech that changes the course of history going to eat more  argentinian steaks unlike our country today argentinians should be very proud of their president amazing what happens when you have paper ballots no machines same day voting and voter id
thank you president milei for a very educated insightful and important message  many world leaders should learn from you
there are pills for what ails ya
awesome great summary of the decline of the west thank you argentina for the warning
controlled opposition
milei  i did not come to lead lambs i came to awaken lions
down with the wef
yes taxation is theft
klaus schwab would be pulling the hair he doesnt have
inconvertible truth in a nutshell well said
falklands are british
massive respect wow  smart man   i hope the other leaders listen to him 
brilliant and accurate speech well said sir
what a warrior
this begs the question why have speakers like milei and kevin roberts heritage foundation president  speak when they know what they are going to say  these globalists are anything except stupid they have a reason they will use this against the free world they have already stated that misinformation is their greatest threat  they will use these speeches as examples of misinformation it all comes down to who do you trust  i am to the point that there is nobody i trust above myself
finally a elected leader had the spunk to tell these globalist that the davos agenda can pound sand  awesome speech should be heard world wide
the problem with people shaping world economic forum is not that they dont know that capitalism increases gdp its the fact they want the gdp to start going down because they think rising gdp is destroying the planetarguing for capitalism as a way to increase gdp is actually an argument against it in the eyes of the collectivists who hold us hostage to the good of the planetthe collectivists think that we cannot have global capitalism because that would put even more stress on earths resources
another well oiled balljoint
refreshing to hear a president speak the truth right to their faces
im more worried about the fact that ai has been able to generate this whole thing taking his original speech translating it to english and getting all the lip movement rightit just makes you wonder just what the hell can you believe when you see it on a screen nowif it can do all that  cant it make him say just about anything
thank you for your sanity facts and truth but watch out sir after president trump addressed these billionaire moguls they publicly said he had to go and they privately funneled their vast wealth to the american left to ensure americas strongest president was defeated in 2020  good luck sir and may god bless you
only if youre already rich
if you listen closely his voice sounds like robin williams
i a free american envy argentina their gifted president
im gonna guess he doesnt get invited next year
legend
boring  as long as central banks can manipulate interest rates and there are legal tender laws there can be no such thing as a free market
too bad no one has the balls in this country to say that except for trump why cant we have people here that actually stand for this shit its what this country was built on and some foreigner is saying what an american should be there saying i love the guy dont get me wrong but it should be us up there its pathetic and sad our founding fathers would be so devastated they did everything they did for us for nothing
the growth was exponential at that period of time because of various types of fossil fuels and the technologies to utilize them the growth wouldve occurred no matter what economic system the energy was applied to im not saying the capitalism is a bad thing but attributing a hockey stick of economic growth to that time due to capitalism is just not accurate
this guy gives me hope for what i have always believed deep down that there is an alliance behind the scenes how powerful i do not know but an alliance exists to stop these freaking psychos
i love this let freedom ring country after country needs leaders to stand for everything he said
amen
right in the nails head i hope you live long and keep being free to place in action all you have spoke today
just for the translation when he says   colectivism is altruistic con la ajena con la ajena means it is altruistic with somebody elses goods not with their own con  la plata  ajena
social justice is poison
yes  please listen to him
hes a golden god
a little truth in a den of thieves and liars
milei spoke of the life liberty and property first penned by british philosopher john locke in his two treatises of government they were used to defend the claim that all men are free and possess the inalienable right to life liberty and property independent from the laws of any specific society this was part of the foundation locke used to describe where the people under a social contract willingly transfer some of their fights to government in order to better enjoy the stable enjoyment of their lives liberty and property meaning that under this social contract the government exists with the consent of the governed to protect the rights of people and that governments that fail to do so can be resisted and replaced by the people thomas jefferson who respected locke replaced the word property with the pursuit of happiness in the us declaration of independence which he likely borrowed from locke again who wrote in a 1690 essay titled concerning human understanding the pursuit of happiness is the foundation of liberty these words became part of the united states of americas declaration of independence
best speech ive ever heard
great job increase your security detail klaus must have had a melt down
fake fake fake look at his mouth and his glasses why is this fake
wow a robot iawhose bot is this
ai video watch his mouth
roundup  drugd gmo killer of all soil   even humans see movie  the need to grow   eg a new sustainable power grid   makes a jurassic growth harvest fertilizer  win win situation  carbon w
in the 1800s it was the theft and genocide of indigenous peoples of america that created the wealth 
he says while stealing his peoples money and giving it to genocide israel
usa to president meili  will come and be our president
yeah but its much more nuanced than just access to capital the growth of technology and innovation the blood sweat and tears of scientists engineers and inventors not all of them were paid handsomely for their work and if you truly analyse it a lot of great ideas come when you dont have easy access to moneylook at nikola tesla today our entire population relies on his technology yet he was ridiculed and died poor and lonelyi dont believe putting our faith in the largest and most successful companies blindly is also the solution to our prosperityhere in australia the big 2 supermarkets have continued to raise prices in unison and because they have accumulated so many different products and for many years undercut everyone else there is now nowhere else to go to buy some products at sensible prices often bespoke places are 23x more expensive which means its harder for individuals to change the market by voting with our walletsalso these supermarkets never pay their suppliersfarmers a good price and have more and started to replace popular brands with their own brands and they push up the price of the popular brands and then supply an inferior product at the old price of the popular brandeventually all of those popular brands will stop doing business and the quality of the food will continue to degrade until there is absolutely no nutritional value leftwhy because someone makes more money every time they cut cornersfunny i dont think the people who have made the biggest positive impact in our world were solely motivated by money
100 that is robin williams
have you ever noticed that the nations in the world who have the largest populations and are also catholic are among the very poorest nations too ever seen how much wealth that the catholic church owns  my grandfather 1985
funny how the logo for the world economic forum skewers 3 0s and smiles under rum
i want him to be my president
very impressive
the unfortunate failing of libertarianism is that you simply cannot live and let live with authoritarians and the left is inherently collectivist and authoritarian
this is a man right thereand that speech can be the speech who changes everythingthats speech can wake up some peoplelets hope  for sure this man talk with hes hart
i disagree on too many points to count but i think i just disagree with all of it and i dont like it
thank you  finally someone said it   for all to hear
the increasing gap between the rich and poor congratulations west
we must accept our corporate masters
bravo sir
this man is a legend 
he would fit right in with usa fonding fathers
people need to listen to this guy because he knows whats happening he is against this agenda 21 aka new world order crapso he is putting info out there for people to realize what these idiotic politicians are really trying to do
god bless javier milei
the west has groomed argentina because once again as in 1945 the nazis of the west need a safe haven to run to
he all but said who is responsible thanks barry
very good but now this people will try to fight against any posibility of the necessary changes
he failed to see the ever widening gap between the rich and poor todays west is poorer
zog puppet
are you listening california
this is truly not fake news may god protect this man
what does milei think of the gaza war a triumph of capitalism
that is exactly what i said down the pub last week  word for word
somebody has to say itglad pres milei has the balls to do itand in their own venue and to their face
are you sure this man is not related to the united states founding fathers i would vote for him as my president of the united states of america argentina you are blessed to have such a wise leader that puts you first and wants you to be secure free healthy and wealthy unlike the politicians and our current president of the united states that wants to sell us out to the world economic forum that hates the american people that looks down on us as slaves god bless this man i will probably listen to his speech a dozen times i have currently sent this to everyone that i know
totally agree with everything he said  but i am very suspicious how he was allowed to say it bearing in mind that the majority of the people there oppose it   what is the real reason he was he allowed to make that speech  mmmm
mr austin milei powers muahaha respect
capitalism  usury that cannot be denied the american system is not capitalism but it is instead the free trade market system the world was lifted out of poverty due to the industrial revolution contrary to what people say when they falsely attribute it to capitalism capitalism utilizes usury which is criminal interest rates also known as compound interest we dont need capitalismcompound interest usury in order to have a functional free trade market system we can create money at 0 interest as the christian doctrine has dictated and uplift the entire world out of poverty alongside the industrialization
the producers vs the regulators
free market capitalism it might be a bit better if we had that what we have is a system of neoliberalism  look it up ask yourself why we in the west fund war over hospitals and schools there are people living on the streets in the uk and the us and yet this is not due to communism or socialism this is under a current capitalist systemcorporations like blackrock are buying up everything including homes they own the media they lobby the governments they own the military industrial complex there is no freedom  you are all slaves and you buy into this concept that they will ever let you reach your best you are one paycheck away from destitution rise up
brilliant man what he says is very true
bravo an actual human being this man needs to be protected against all the evil politicians out there
the problem we have now is too many monopolies being allowed to continue companies like blackrock and vanguard should be broke up when a company gets that big they begin to bring in the evils of capitalism and why our founding fathers left rules on monopolies
i appreciate you president javier milei i hope you begin to lead the shift back to true progress and prosperity to the western world
this one speech alone gives me hope its not to late for america were completely off the rails young americans cant even discern what gender they are let alone whats right and wrong politicians are captured and only concern them selves with power and monetary gain the government is the biggest threat to american citizens forcing us to take experimental untested drugs america is so disgusting right now and most people dont seem to care they just keep consuming and slave away while the government poisons them its absolutely insane 
why is it skipping are they taking out some words he used
long live freedom damnit
f the wef
why is he at the wef seems he is speaking aginst everything they stand for
a president with big balls
the un is corrupt and needs to be expelled out of our country and we need to withdraw from the un
thats my man the antitrudeau  this is what the world needs now
so good ole uncle sam get out of the way  to stimulate the economy doing less is more  this guy from argentina understands the american dream better than 70 of our current leadership it is an honor to have a civilian job  youre a part of the process that turns dirt into something of value  that turns useless people into useful more wealthy citizens   i believe we need some government  but it should not distort the free market  free market will build wealth  it will destroy inefficient systems making room for leaner hungrier more efficient systems it is not a governments function to bail out badly run companies it is not a governments function to create wealthit is not a governments function to do anything but enforce fair trade and protect the nation against threats foreign or domestic  like invaders or thieves and murderers we have the bomb and a means to deliver it anywhere on earth  we should take comfort in the fact that most people dont want to die at any one time  respect a government that respects your citizenship  that trusts you  when it does not than it deserves none from you  god bless this big blue marble and everyone who lives onin it
jeez finally a voice of reason among the evil architects of the nwo
america has had 40 years of reaganfriedman free market capitalism leeching off our work hollowing out our social society then javier blames this capitalist death machine on socialism because his nation has backward subsidies that any sane marxistinfluenced market socialist could easily debunk nations like argentina need a clean slate of debt via developed world central bank loan forgiveness lower export barriers to the rich nations then small nations can to build up their economies without subsidies so the population can take advantage of a fair  regulated global trade system
the wef has stated that misinformation and disinformation is on their agenda so does that mean yt and other techs will censor and cancel more than it does now
theyre there to try to regain trust remember
brilliant
this is an amazing use of ai wow
get rid of the word we we do not do anything we were not ever asked to contribute to this and we will never be asked in todays world there is i and you but no we this is why i refer all members of the wef as they as they plan on taking we out
this is the man and the speach the world needs right now
the wests social globalists are too greedy in their self interest to recognize this amazing speech
i truly like this guy 
this guy is on point
great speech mr president we need more leaders like you
i feel this mans days are numbered  please join me in praying for him
is it true that davos attendees have to pay 500000 to attendif so thats a nice little earner for the wef
life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
his voice is so soothing has he done an audio book yet 
yes yes yes thank god someone has the cahones to stand up and tell the whole truth he is a hero in my book
 love this brave man 
the heavenly voice of an angel amongst a fire pit of demons maybe there is some hope on the horizon as long as he can stay alive
hes technically saying stop being nosy to politics and givernments
western country is doomed
president milei is one intelligent human 
dude its not rocket science  anyone with a brain knows its a balance between private and public sectors  this is the genius of the founding fathers in the us  checks and balances  racist and other cultural issues are just nonsense meant to divide  nobody cares where your johnson goes  the modern republican party is very misrepresented
beautiful speech
who would have thought argentina leading the way in the worldgood for you argentina at least you have an honest speaking president unlike the rest of us
hillary called him to send condolences for his upcoming accident
wish he was my president
loooveee this guy extra extra read all about it
he is so awesome  inside the lions den facing them head on  total respect for mr milei
may god bless this brilliant and honest leader and his country  argentina    maga24
wow
yes but when most of that generated wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few at the top while most people in the world suffer from starvation oppression and other miseries and the rest struggle to survive but become poorer as the richest few become richer there is a problem with that system when the leaders of corporations rule over and oppress and impoverish and harm the other people that is a problem was freemarket economics meant to result in a few billionaires wallowing in enormous wealth and luxury while everyone else struggles to find a way to live i dont think so we need the kind of free market that does better than that
at least more people hear this here than were in the roomthis speech even exists thanks to itas he says  if it works great if not  reassess your realityso usa put the guns down to start with
trump 2024
love this guy  can the us borrow him   props to every argentine who voted for him  it wont be easy but your country is on the right path
good shit
automatic driving alone will wipe out a huge number of jobs not just truckies but airline pilots bus driver ship staff train drivers tyen there are the professions such as accountancy engineering and even medical given the immense power of ai and the blockchaincomparing post industrial revolution history of growth in employment is an example of the old adage  what goes up  must come down and solutions must be createdimagine a world with 80 unemployment with all necessities provided
finally  a politician that speaks the truthhow did we get to 99 of politicians speaking bs to fill their own pockets and only 1 with morals still intact
preach brother preach 
the state is the problem  truer words were never spoken bravo
never trust the elitesthey have their own agenda which does not include anything that benefits average people
go tell em 
as if he got away with this in satans house he must have been cooking kids at the time
plutocracy
wow  this was spot on market manipulation by those in control is the real problem not capitalism
wonderful   get rid of al the wef and globalist predators  they have never meant well thats for sure thank you sir
outstanding
wow simply wow should be mandatory viewing in all universities
pay your bills argentina than you can talk shit
great man
why does his mouth move like a game character
what the susi was shocked about his speech until i saw this vid translated then edited so his mouth matches the words and then spoke in his voice with aithe future is doomed with this kind of tech running around imagine if the disclosures were never given and this was marketed as real this guys could be saying anything and a less knowledgeable persons would take it all as having happened
the wef leaders see human suffering as not bad but good and necessary they want ai robots to replace humans but first step is to mass migration to create slave labor to class to replace middle class and replace true capitalism with cronythat said great speech more power to those willing to stand up to the powers that be whether they are good intentioned or down right sinister each one can decide
055 became the 1st world power  i dont think so ai got that one wrong the original says became a leadind world power big difference
this is because it doesnt matter what people say the plan is already in place
excelent 
im pushed to brake the only community rule this guy is dangerous
thanks for traslate bro more people need to hear and watch this speach
its fool to praise western economic system their economy was built from colonialism robbery nowadays its more difficult to rob because the world is more multi polar the western economy is deteriorating an depending on debts to grow
i agree that competition is the gold standard but this requires a truly free market where businesses compete on a level playing field  only the government can enforce competition and failing to do so will allow the haves via their ownership of monopoly stocks to get an everincreasing share of the economy at the expense of the have nots eventually the have nots are economically squeezed to the point where they follow a demagogue and democracy along with human rights comes to an end we are presently facing this abyss in the 2024 election
i love this guy
these economic indications does not account for the raping of the planet from an ecological standpoint it does not account for limited resources and land area  there is pressure exerted by unprecedented human capital in terms of growing numbers
love milei  finally the truth
this is edited af i call bs
 fantastic speech
i am amazed by the ai technology used to make him speak in english even the video change the moveme t of his mouth in english my president is the best viva la libertad carajo
that crook will be one of the worst that the wef placed at the head of a country well soon see riots just like in all countries the wef placed their pawns after canada france venezuela brazil will be argentinas turn
is this real it looks like an ai fake
did javier google up the wealth rise graph what a load of lies hes selling
another fact i want to express in america and other unregulated capitalist countries it is not the socialist that is preventing people from owning stuffthe actual people standing in the way with people owning what they buy in these countries are the capitalistthe gaming industry is trying to do away with people owning the games they buythis movie is pretty much been succeeding on thiscar companies currently are trying to turn car ownership into a service insteadso companies seem to not want people to own anything because they can make way more money through a subscriptionbut i like owning the stuff i buy
awesome but these jokers at the wef already know this nobody is stupid enough to believe anyother way unless ofcourse its a control thing now everyone just get in the cattle car for your own safety
what a fantastic speech finally someone is speaking the truth about what some of the world leaders are up to great job
very bad made
why does he sound indian in this translation tho lol
he looks and sounds like a snake oil salesman he is here to solve wolrd poverty genius what a guy why am i not president of some country yet
it would be fantastic if this person would come and run canada as our prime minister because the one we have now is a complete wimp and fool
we need more words like these in the usa  we dont need more controls by office workers of the state
hard to argue in support of the post wwii development pattern here in n america weve been doing a lot of dumb shit if prosperity means building communities that are unsafe to navigate outisde of a large suv or truck lined with dollar stores fast food chains box stores with huge parking lots r1 zoning that creates perpetual scarcity and a whole other slew of issues im not sure i even want it
long live argentina fight for freedom 
superb ai translation i thought i saw his mouth moving strangely but this is pretty awesome not having to hear a translator as long as its verbatim
this is a fantastic speech im pretty sure it goes against everything the wef agenda stands for but it is the truth and hopefully people will start to hear and understand all of this great speech
fake zoom in on his mouth
whats up with the edits
would it be possible to clone him and prep for mass production milton friedman trained him well
thank god for javier milei 
never ever be socialism for me you and all of us its a deliberate hand made crime against humanity this man is brilliant he has a courage to stand against whole world im sure main stream media will downplay or twist his speech oh well at least we heard it thank you for posting 
thank god for president milei 
they dont care about bringing people oit of poverty or people in general other than themselves alone
this is an outstanding speech with massive truth i cant believe they let him finish
amen and hallelujah i was losing hope i would ever hear the words of this man  please all listening give a thumbs up to this speech and elect leaders to follow his true words
this is ai he doesnt speak english
should anyone be taking lessons from argentinas economic miracle s
what about the millions exterminated to achieve these economic returns these humans do not countthis is why we have bitcoin the ultimate freedom to harness your own life energy
the end of that speech gives me goose bumps
about damn time someone told these elites to their faces that they are wrong
why is the video cut upit keeps skipping and repeating 
defeat the matrix globally in 2024
i like this man i want him in my country oh yeah
he did not commit suicide
if democrats win then the globalist win
whats with the cuts though ai translation doesnt account for that does it did it also change his mouth movements

scandinavia in general isnt doing bad with democratic socialism
excellent speech and well delivered 
what a brilliant speech a pity this cannot be read to the british parliament
he is good watching from scotland

i really hope this man can have a long life but judging by what is normally happening i wouldnt be surprised he fell from a balcony
the original version is better
 this man and trump can and will move mountains
america under bidens  regime hes right on
awesome awesome awesome love it
i was disappointed to learn milei was part of wef but now i have hope hes the wolf dressed in sheeps clothing representing the 99
wow  this speech should be known by the title what we learned from  after america
unrestricted capitalist eventually creates monopoly and oligarchy in a war he sells shells to the enemy he bribes govenmnent this is basics still so many are buying into free market agenda
great truths being spoken in the great cathedral of greed communism and evil
so china a successful free market economy or a market failure
please america listen to this man argentina is headed for great economic growth and prosperity this philosophy is what made america great and prosperous and made us a magnet where all wanted to be here to give a better life to their children when i watch the product of our universities i am so frightened for america and my childrens futures
dont fall for any of their bs look at where he is giving the speech at the club the club that he belongs to
my g
america used to be like that when it first started not anymore hasnt been that way for  god knows how long
haha is it just me or at 1207 it looks like he has a mini face under his eyes  the shadow from the glasses looks like a second pair and a small little goblin face underneath lol
perfect milei

free markets and capitalism describe two different thingsthe former is a system of trade while the latter is a system of propertydo not speak of them together in a single breath as if it describes a single systemis it free markets or capitalism that is responsible for our success and to what degree i would argue that it is largely free marketsthe  question then becomes what degree of capitalistic property is necessary to support and maximize value within these markets no one in davos would like the answeremployees having a greater share of their labors is desirable residents owning their own homes is desirable ultra wealthy brats who inherited much of their wealth is certainly notoften free markets are in opposition to capitalismi repeat do not use these two terms in a single breath as if it describes a single system
wow he said this right in the wolfs den god bless
his mouth looks ai
viva argentina
ai translation and lip sync
love this man he is the donald trump of argentina exposing the deep state and corrupt globalists and demons like soros and schwab
oh oh xavier claus wont invite you to davos 2025 you might have spilled the beans
how come one of the worlds most evil organisations let this man speak such anti them things
so far i like him  he also combed his hair  
nonsense another economist who is definitely not a scientist it was the enslavement of fossil fuels and the rise of colonialism that triggered growth the capitalists have a convenient correlation to justify their claim for credit and how do they explain the obvious problem of the boundary condition of a finite planet consuming exponentially impossible this guy is the worst example of the bullshit mantra of neoliberal economists
i love this speech
just excellent
thank you
those are cojones and no mamadas
protect this man
i love this guy trump 2024
ill start by fact checking him on one important thing argentina is not a western country only he thinks that dream on
it would be nice if he joined tucker carlson on the stage with danielle smith in edmonton alberta when hes up here 
the name of the hero is javier milei 
well i would argue that there hasnt been true capitalism in the west in 50 yearsinstead of productive capitalism the financial system has grown to overshadow the effects of classic capitalism the financial system act more like feudalism growing without producing anything without contributing anything only accumulating wealth that should otherwise circulate through real capitalism ever gaining power by using power over other peoplethe deregulation of the financial system has essentially killed the good effects of capitalism the classic capitalism idea did not include financial systems running wild like they are and the classic capitalism thinkers did not condone an unregulated financial system only unregulated capitalism in the productive formso color me sceptic every time i hear someone praise capitalism and then i want to ask  what exactly do you mean by capitalism one of the greatest and ignore problems in this world is the out of control financial system that has grown so big that capitalism socialism whatever ism doesnt really matter anymore  only by addressing the problem of the financial system and the wealth accumulation by contributing nothing can capitalism begin to work againthe world enslavement forum agendas are very similar to feudalism their member are the modern versions or lords and normal people will be the serfs  very much not capilism but also no socialism they only use socialism as a disguise
this is insane i watched this speech live and seeing it ai translated into his own voice in english is mind boggling
what a speech  respect for this man argentina are lucky to have such a leader
wow finally a world leader who speaks the truth and follows common sense  he is right the west is being destroyed by the large corps and the main stream medias propaganda iff this continues the world will be run by a few unelected  elites who will have all the power and we the peoples of the free world will lose everything and basically become serfs to those elites all free  peaple should  look at all the the freedoms we lost and all the lies and sensorship world wide that promoted a narrative   that these globalists demand and  with all the new data and real life data about the covid disaster   it shows how much hardship to the common person cam be coused by a group of peaple with a agenda  remeber socilism only works untill they run out of money to steel then it turns into a dictatorship and the peaple pay the price
david icke comments on the mikei speechi heard that mileis speech at the wef champions freedom so i listened it doesnt it seeks to move power and control from governments to corporations if you listen carefully and thats happening anyway what he doesnt say is that governments and corporations are owned by the same global cult so either way the same cabal is in controlthe obsession with economic growth for its own sake is classic freeforall childlike economics in which the strongest most wealthy and powerful prevail without the most basic checks and balanceseconomic growth is merely the amount of money spent on goods and services so all the negative things that we dont want to happen are ticked as positive by economic growth if money changes hands and profits are madefreedom to be exploited by billionaires without redress is not freedom corporate monopolies with unchecked power is not freedomhe talks about capitalism but what he is describing in truth is cartelismits barely onedimensional its the playground you challenge white with black and black with white while the cult sits laughing in the shades of grey controlling bothmilei is a child in a grownups playground appearing to challenge power while handing it over to the already superpowerful which do you want the free rigged market tyranny run riot or statedictated communist tyrannyneither thanks im an adult i want freedom and justice for all not the few and whether its milei or schwab the few get the spoils and the rest get the crumbs and the tyranny
he speaks 100  the truth and americas elites and that very community hes talking to is the problem americas elites want nothing then to kill of the majority and make them poor and reliant on them they want to rule our lives and destroy them
finally one lone leader dares to speak the truth
he says socialism all the time notice that who are the real socialist countries today i wonder if he can name them 1 and if thatd pass a good fact check 2
we americans have the better part of the year to raise a libertarian party to take our government back i want my own milei
only in the us we have unregulated capitalism and rich get richer and the poor get poorer
the correct answer lies in the middle  capitalism will fail without checks and balances look at the 2008 financial crisis the system failed because checks and balances were removed and that caused irresponsible behavior on all sides
beautifully said  he probably wont be invited to come back next year wef  are  
the globalist elite want less people on earth easy answer is end socialism abruptly worldwide and just announced martial law
brilliant speech
you speak very well in english sir
may hurt him
respect to this brave man 
this is the best speech ever
great speech
i completely agree with everything this man describes but what about oil spills  accidents  fake doctors standards of lawyers and standards of engineers enforced by centralized bodies  there are some times where centralized controls are a good thing  that being said i am a free market capitolist
what you meen my internet is still working just fine
hes right trudeau is leading us down the garden path of socialism
lets go argentina is going to blossom again d
ai almost had me fooled xd
bravooo bravoo exactly what i think gj man  finally some1 says something true
this really is a beautiful speech
sadly capitalism has probably killed even more than 100s of millions dont forget that there are people who grow more wealthy through supporting the selling of weapons to both sides of a conflict whilst others deliberately rush to sink their money into defence stocks whenever a new war breaks out the sad truth is this capitalism thrives on the misfortunes of others and yet collectivism allows fewer to have wealth but generally does not aid and abet the killing of others capitalist freedom vs socialist servitude wealth is not the answer freedom to live in unity with your brother  sister is the thing to aim for surely also there is much folly in assuming that gdp growth is real wealth growth dont forget the effects of inflation and the increasing wealth inequality the rich get richer and the poor get poorer no matter the political system just think back 10 years  sure you may have more money now but is it worth as much as it once was
please save britain
but the real key is this  the powers that be dont want socialism they just frame it like that   they want a great reset as in society as a whole
seems like he knows the liberal left
but isnt argentina where all the nazis went im just asking
who is john galt
wow maybe things will turn positive for argentina  i think he should counsel our congressmen and congresswomen
human beings are incapable of socialism that would work as an examplewith say antsit works no member of the colony gets rich there is no human frailty such as greedenvy etc    as for humans the people with money and power will never give that up  therefore socialism wont work  the only thing you will have is a monarchy those at the top and everyone else
friggin awesome this guy is a legend
beautiful
hear hear
someone has been reading ayn rand you have my support suit up its gonna be a rough ride my friend
the original version is not in english and was translated thats someone elses mouth talking and a highly edited video to english im not sure but it does sound spot on and exactly what was said by javier when tucker carlson interviewed him he was translated
i have a huge amount of respect for this man wish we could replace trudeau with him
look at the facelooks fake
imagine if milei was in charge of wef and economic freedom was the philosophy it was advocating worldwide
so naive the  independent journalist knows his story before he became candidate but is only in spanish the same sharks
free assange make freedom of speech lawful again
listening to this guy almost made me throw upman what a bunch of bull
millei trump 2024
well economic growth is insane directly since 1970 when the us went to a fiat debt based economic system the silent g and boomers made out like bandits at the top of the pyramid 35 trillion in us debt tells you nothing has been paid for just extended credit the usa just did it again with a raise and for 1 12 months time frame cmon man
its great how he is making a difference in the whole world not just argentinacomo √© bom ter presidente
why is the video skipping so much its heavily edited
capitalism has had its run and look at the situation were in the fact that this angry man is insisting that capitalism is peachy says so much
keep up the great work argentina with all the natural resources you have it all  and with the great motivated people of your country you will be the number one  jai sri ram  jai hind 
wef must have melted into a pool of   this speech needs to repeated everywhere
whatever he is talking about it exactly matches eu structure and development where bureaucrats went to far and are creating environment with total control over lives of their citizens this seems to be the model for wide adoption most of them are not even elected by masses  and they call it the greatest democracy but it turns to become the greatest lie  thank you javier milei to clarify  this in front of the world hope you will succeed with argentina to cut dominance of others and become again truly independent nation first coming through financial independence 
i dont think this is real this is all ai its to make it look like he went there and spoke for all of us meanwhile he really works for them just like trump works for them this is all illusion to keep us settled down and feel like we have friends at the top
to hell with the elite and collectivism
capitalism is not about free economy but free collection of financial resources in the hands of few
corruption and money is why good speech thank you
yes socialism which human kindness is ruining the world
he talks about contradiction in terms but then keeps referencing free market capitalism dont get me wrong i love the guy and the speech but you either have a free market or you have capitalismthe main difference is in the latter you have government intervention while with the former there is no intervention and we cant have these discussions without talking about the monetary system within any market fiat paper is not a sound monetary system which ultimately leads to tyranny or destruction
god bless this man 
im moving to argentina if they pull this off
internet is still working
absolutely brilliant speechthankyou 
oh my goodness if my argie friends dont want him they can always send him to britain hell be most welcome its a long time since i heard pure common sense devoid of ego what a brilliant talk
you will never see anything like this in the mainstream biased media
abc as clear as it is clean and pure science government interventionism distorts everything
bidens master plan  trash the constitution   replace with a socialist society ruled by big government   take our rights money mobility  and keep the country divided   neighbor against neighbor
he is confused the reason behind the economic progress is not capitalism is technology at a scale never hace seen beforecapitalism didnt lift 90 of the population out of poverty a globalized technologically advanced society china is the second world power not because its under capitalism but because it also has access to the same multiplier and global theaterif capitalism or socialism were responsible for this wealth we currently experience then either the us capitalism champion would have zero poverty or china communist champion would have zero poverty the fact that neither has been able to eradicate poverty confirms this is not a problem of which system is better which one is the one we should thank for the good things we see
mr president you geve me hope
fantastic
socialism is good for everyone capitalism is good for fewer corrupted
a fine example of ai put to a good use a fine speech from a man with true and good intentions for all intelligent unimpeachable truth  give thanks argentina 
thank you presidentyou are the only onethat speaks the truth
he wont be returning
booooooooom
capitalism is good corrupt capitalism is what is bad   dont cry for me argentina   bravo 
a lot of you might not know this but this speech was entirely generated by ai by clone his voice and then lip syncing the audio with the videoin the future al videos will likely have this functionality also deep fakes will reign so we can trust anything
i know socialism is synonymous with dictatorship but i think dictatorship should be said because if they dont have to give anything they wont
aw shame he mispronounced his pay off line
this is a historical moment in the history of the world viva la libertad carajo
what tttttttttttt 
the elites and the elective public  officials our governments  are scared that when the aliens step forward finally  showing themselves to us they will be down graded into our slave class
just goes to show you what the world  its people  in a whole pretty much want  its certainly not what those elite in davos are trying key word here  trying  to offer or force  wake up yaall  god bless
i am shocked that they allowed this speech it was awesome
well theres one intelligent person educating wef golddiggers
god bless that man were in a fight for our lives now with this commi wef and the corrupt eu
wow theres the truth
the amount of bots in the comments is remarkable
while the speech compellingly outlines the successes of capitalism particularly in driving economic growth and reducing global poverty its crucial to also recognize the systems limitations and the potential consequences of unregulated capitalism indeed capitalism has been a powerful engine for innovation and wealth creation but its unchecked form can lead to significant social and environmental issuesone stark example is the historical exploitation of labor epitomized by events like the coal wars in the united states during the early 20th century coal miners faced incredibly harsh working conditions low pay and the constant threat of injury or death their efforts to unionize and strike for better conditions were often met with violent responses including interventions by the national guard such incidents underscore the potential for capitalism to exploit workers when devoid of strong labor protections and regulationsenvironmental impact is another critical area of concern the pursuit of profit in capitalist systems can and often does lead to environmental degradation this is evident in the contrast between industrialized and nonindustrialized cultures for instance the deforestation of the amazon rainforest driven by the capitalist motives of logging agriculture and mining starkly contrasts with the sustainable practices of indigenous communities who have lived in harmony with their environment for centuries the current climate crisis largely fueled by the carbon emissions of industrialized nations is a testament to the environmental cost of unregulated industrial activitymoreover the issue of social inequality is an inherent risk in capitalist systems while capitalism can generate immense wealth this wealth is often unevenly distributed leading to significant disparities the growing gap between the richest and the poorest both within countries and globally raises questions about the social sustainability of current economic modelswhile capitalism has been a driving force in creating modern prosperity its unregulated form can lead to labor exploitation environmental destruction and social inequality these challenges highlight the necessity of thoughtful regulation and the implementation of policies that ensure economic growth does not come at the expense of human welfare and environmental sustainability the goal should be to strike a balance where the dynamism of capitalism is harnessed but its excesses are curbed ensuring a fair and sustainable future for all
the president of argentina just called out the globalist cult protect this man at all costs power to the people  freedom for all humanity 
its hard to take this guy seriously when he looks like benny hill
i listened to his every word very engaging speaker
love milei exposing the wef agenda
he have it to them with no lubrication
the reason  is capitalism has been exploiting african and asian colonies now the whole south is smarting up getting independent   independent and rebelling ssoon the so called free capitalism will fail
klas must surely eat his tongue for inviting javier more of his kind will change the world he called these psychopaths out on their own stage without a chain saw
pass this on to friends and familyfabulous speechpeople are finally waking up to the wef and davos hypocritical elite who want to control us
i love this guy
surprised they didnt shut off his microphone
i wouldnt be surprised if the immigration to argentina skyrocketed hell i wanna go canada is not what i remember and it sucks so much now
bollocks
thank you
yes free enterprice sustains growth and prosperity but javier milei is not aware that its all an illusion because the world so called debts wll extinguish all wealth free enterprice must fall with the usury monetary system in other words free enterprice is the way but it has been sabotaged by the corrupt financial system
loved this video i tell americans all the time this is why we need an independenttrue libertarianism type president you can put anybody in that presidential seat and we will be fine because the people drive the economy now get a president who is also on board and for the people which is what most americans complain they dont have but want and imagine what we can do the two party system is broken in america they look like real housewives of dc fighting between them each day getting nothing done and now 34 trillion in debt i am also a small business owner and loved hearing him call me a hero never heard my president say that to me
capitalism might work somewhat ok in  social justice until slavery is brought in the mix and thats where we are at millions of slaves doing the dirty work ofc unpayed that kind of global economy is broken
it wont be long before the elites pull a witchhunt on this guy like they did with trump
1742 the path of economic slavery is the actual term as i am an old barbarian that just wont work for me
meanwhile 1250 million indigenous peoples in the usa were genocided land converted into growth and we are facing catastrophic climate change nuclear holocaust dying oceans infected with plastics and war after war looking at the us historical record
a strong clear and very true speech about a world that is increasingly sinking into leftist utopia bravo javier milei congratulations on your courage 
i would love to hear a little more on argentina  i will also research on my own  i love your ideas and i applaud you for your common sense   the european countries are being destroyed by illigal immigration  and people that are uneducated unemployable  living off taxpayers money  crime rate in europe is going up and the few countries that europeans considered safe will be ran by european union          if argentina can show major improvement  youll have people with financial means moving towards your direction
he sounds so gentle in english
and to think this is what america used to be we have to tell these one world order a holes to go pound sand god gave all humans free choice never let some insane group of powermongers put their foot on our neck america and the world must stand together for freedom not socialism or communism or control through food shortages or medicine or threats of disease its all about control and power to the wef and the insane world powermongers and moneymongers harm no one love god be free
love good people
speaking to canada
this is a leader
well said
javier is my man the world needs more of his fiestyness could not give a flying duck about schwab and fellow psychopaths  give this man a johnny walker blue on ice
i live in the united states of america and this guy knows freedom united states has turned heavily communist thinking about moving to argentina
perfect wef is n way out and will slam the floor  self indulgent selfish people will not make it in this energy period
love this guy bet he pissed off all of the self appointed elites present
the taxes raised by governments is nothing but a government protection racket if you dont pay up then you could be jailed or fined now if you take into account then following income tax heating fuel tax car fuel tax vat road tax council rates stamp duty for home purchase inheritance tax capital gains tax come to the end of your life what you leave on death is also taxed the system is rank rotten the guy from argentina is 100 right
coercive control was made illegal in 2015
somebody that has the guts to speak the truth
the top conversation here should be about the population control  does anyone have info on official sources
amazing speech given to a group of people that dont want everyone to succeed and flourishthe prospect of millions of people dying due to their policies is part of their goal
id trust this guy more if this speech werent delivered trust nothing
ai translation is getting pretty good its even making his mouth look like hes speaking english
wonderful speech
at last a leader that makes sense they will have to demonize him  watch the media demons fork tongue
capital and growth may have increased but please provide the gap between the most poor and the most richeven if we remove 50 of the wealth if we spread it evenly most of us will still be insanely richcapitalism creates wealth 95 for the select few and current leaders avoid true free market practices as always bailing out some companies subsidising others all to drain taxes back into their own pocketscapitalism could be great  but the way its applied currently sure as hell isnt
the best president of argentina 
whats thew point in controlling the money supply if no one can create industrys china aint making anything they have to wait for the west to make it first
he had clearly done his homework and presented the true factssomething the elites in the chairs wont handlebut nevertheless is how we the people stand by his words
maybe i will go to davos after all
en puerto rico les decimos simberguenzas 
hes days are counted he is pushing luck to the extreme
maybe i will go to davos
its all planned to believe that they are good its a trap for all of us they are aware of the awakening
dile la verdad 
viva argentina 
wow
he is a plant fish
iam moving to argentina
i find all the sudden criticism of the wef at their own event a little suspect all these self righteous individuals are uncharacteristically docile in the face of being told all their ideas are wrong and always have been i think this is all part of the pantomime
so why are people struggling where has all the money gone
thank you god
i can only hope that the tyrant justin trudeau is listening to this speech he has done every wrong turn in policy that this speech touches on
god bless argentina from the usa be safe mrpresadent
excellent god bless you sir
love it
from puerto rico gracias por ver la verdad gracias 
amazing speech and technology that enabled the translation europe and the british isles should embrace his convictions are you listening college grads and biden in the us
brawo mr prezydent
milei    her√≥i
thanks 
i pray the world will hear you sir and believe your excellent accurate warning and admonition
wow he has said it all well great speech hope he remains safe
this is our man 
every country on earth is struggling right now
so socialism is the problem is it funny that because its capitalists that are fucking everything up
very inspiring thank you so much a breath of fresh air is an understatement you have me
excellent milei challenged the international mafia the burocrats neo marxists from davos klaus schwab bill gates usula von der layen who want to put the world on slavery  thank you president milei you are a light in this darkness
socialism is only okay for corporations and the rich
bravo mr milei 
a lesson for the entire world listen
politics is the problem market and freedom is the solution
and he left them the grifters and parasites in the audience not just speechless but on the verge of a massive bowel movement
great speech thanks 
they used ai to add those glasses cuz thats not real
this speech will go down in history and be referenced for years to come i hope
lets just stop calling globalism socialism thats not socialism is centered on the dignity of the individual globalism is just the contrary
wow this man is brilliant  argentina has a bright future shame about the rest of usthis is the second speaker that has spoken against the wefthe person who invited these two speakers wont have a job after this
i cant tell if thats really his lips moving or if its just ai
interesting the very speech is being translated with aithe biggest coming deep fake translating the speech in irony
whats with all the cutssplices
go to blm gllo serch enter family last name see all million acres pps up 
he has common sense
the western country he is pinpointing is canada we have our news censored thanks to government legislation our government is dumping money into big business especially quebec companies buying pipelines because they want to not because it makes the most sense forcing agendas in our schools that will be damaging to our childrens state of mind our prime minister was taught how to screw the people from his father who put the wheels in motion to change canada forever and not for the better if he gets back in then we know we have nothing but fools for voters
 heygen ai was used to translate javier milei post from spanish to english and read in his voice you can find the original and ai versions in description and comments below 
aawweessoommee never thought i would hear this in my lifetime long live bolivar long live milei
this was probably a speech for the ages  i almost cried  i sent it to all my friends and family and i  they listen to this not just watch it while scrolling on ticktock  crazy good info while being super succinct farzad you and your editor did everyone a service making this  editor i promise farzad has mentioned you a ton but your name escapes me i know this was probably 100 you so thank you
corporate is going for the kill on politics so that they can finally own us completely
corporate is going for the kill on politics so that they can finally own us completely
time we go live in argentina
way to go argentina electing this man  usa wake up and lets go do the same
im happy for him and satisfied with his work
if you read lips it looks like he is speaking english
what a clown he lives in other planet or universe  poor argentina
ai is magnificentand very very scary
wow great speech
best speech i have ever heard coming out if davos and directed to those elites who want to control us and the world
when can i move to argentina
the ronald reagan of argentina
he knows we have everything to loose 
best english upload of this speech no annoying spanish in the background
just lies and cherry picked lies
i was surprised to find this video on your channel i dont believe you talked about important topics like this before on global lizards and davos secret meetings where they plan wars and pandemics and talk to lizard men while doing drugs and unholy things
god bless this man
stop the evil wef
he sounds like drevil
great speech it is amazing that ai can translate a speech and read it at the persons voice in another language what will it do in 5 years
read this mans lips  he is speaking english  reading some of these posts the foolish people in our world dont like what this man said   i just cannot imagine the world economic forum welcoming him to speak but thank goodness he did  someone mentioned capitalism  without capitalism men and women would still be living in medieval times  at one time it was the aristocracy of the world who kept the working population down  now the multiple nouveau riche throughout the world are as bad if not worse than they were   the likes of bill gates jeff bezos and many others have made their billions on the backs of the ordinary people of our world come to mind  and socialism is not the answer as that form of governance keeps people down   we are not all equal in intelligence or work ethic   but that is what these people at the world economic forum are telling us  they think they have the right to rule us and to take away our freedoms and rights as human beings   this gentleman has touched on everything that affects every human beings life and it is so wonderful to hear someone tell it like it is  our world is full of followers not leaders   and too many leaders in our world today have been won over to the dark side by the lure of money   and that old saying that money is the root of all evil has been proven repeatedly over the past few years especially in north america
this ai translate thing is realy good
words
want to solve world hunger how about teaching people that they shouldnt have children when they know damn well that you cant afford to feed them
a new direction for the world to get into
even if there was some thing as free market capitalism autocratic collective corporations won that competition reason is simple because it is most effective individualism is weaker than than socialism of owners and liberalism is more disorganized than autocracy
wow liked and shared
and socialism promptly made all people equally poor and powerless
this man is clearly far more of a genius than this world deserves he is right
he is brilliant way to go argentina
i wish someone would examine each of the attendees the jets they flew the food they ate the number of rooms how many mansions etc and extrapolate their carbon foot print
psychological aspects of capitalism beware capitalism multiplied by addictive personality traits always morphs into situations where making money becomes more important than making friends dont believe me just look at the military industrial complex and hollywood  and pharmaceutical companies  and on and on and on
who is this outlier genius
he is very correct no more communist which is now currently promoted by dems
tell klaus and his crooked buddies to stuff it
can we clone you mr milei and add you on a global countries scale or better get ellected to lead this planet as whole finally someone with a solution not a problem 
its an ai version of him how can we trust an accurate translation
good man
lol someone deepfaked this into english bravo
wow this man is brilliant viva la presidente 19 minutes of truth at the wef
maga make argentine great again
goat 
controlled opposition yawn 
wonderful man
both mileis libertarianism or the wefs global socialism communitarianism are bastardized schemes of christianity historically the founders early vision for america achieved approximation of a humanassembled government capable of facing human nature orthodox christians continue to await christs return to establish his theocratic kingdom
it is now full force and those who continue to stop a freight train will indubitably fall by the way side  wake up
milei has to be a young global leader playing his role as opposition why else would they let him speak
is this real are you sure this isnt fake  i cant believe my ears the truth at last 
true leader i wish ukraine had same leader
anglosaxon put on new  
this guy is a fact telling beast does he have an american cousin asking for a friend i freaking love this man
wow   fantastic  however he just put a huge target on himself
 you go mr president 
every child is a miracle not a curse and folks have been persuaded that having a child theres nothing worse only the resilient kids aint hitting the psychological skids thanks to climate alarmism and what the transgender activists dids its totalitarian socialism and its all designed to encourage individualism as division shame you wont see any of these bond villains ever go to prison
what argentinas president is saying can be summarized in a few words the lord god had not sent rain in the earth and there was no man to work the groundthe lord god took the man and put him in the garden of eden to work it and take care of it genesis 2515 bravo mr milei
1139  look how interesting
weirdest clown show ever
the fact that multiple western countries are synchronised in their suicidal behaviour has make you think right
long live freedom dammit
just love this man so much we urgently need more great men women like himsick of the ones in power lining their own pockets dont give a damn about people they just blame everyone else lie  preach to everyone about how we should livewell done sir 
this guy is smart
milei you are the only politician that ive heard with a promarket speech in my whole life thank you
dear people of argentina  you have a president in a million  guard him  look after him  protect him because the wef world economic forum will be very very very angry and will want this brave hero dead god take care bless your servsnt president  javier milei and all the beloved argintinian people
telling the truth is dangerous they will do anything  to destroy him
probably one of the most important speeches of our lives share it
where does he gets his facts 90 of the world out of poverty  this man is  crazy 
and who is he appealing to and make happy with his message exactly all the private billionaires and millionaires at davos like bill gates who successfully manage to control people and their lives hes not pissing off the davos billionaires with his speech hes  encouraging them the private sector like the criminal gates to take over
his words in the democrats ears deaf ears unfortunately  because in schools they dont teach history they teach oppressors and oppressed
when will the technocratic cabal ban this dissenting view lol good for him socialism never works in the end but yet is repeated by socalled geniuses in leadership positions throughout history
socialism gave the world the post war consensus  social democracy and the rights people have come to both respect and expect
i just hope he stays focused on the words of the well researched and laid out speech and manages to implement them in real works would be of great service to his nation surrounding countries for that matter to the world all the best to the him his team and argentina
milei is having a shot at socialism you know the system that where the government supports families and individuals who happen to strike some unfortunate incident like unemployment cant afford health care etc just have a look at the us all the evidence exists where idiology that is similar to mileis exists
hell yeah you tell em bilbo baggins
hes telling a bunch of wolves why they shouldnt steal chickens they know theyre lying but its how they make their money
to radically simplify the speech of president mileidont mess with the natural law of supply and demand  long live true capitalism and the free enterprise model  if capitalism fails it is most likely due to the invasion of government law and regulation
we need leadership like this everywhere
brilliant but he wont last much longer sadly he had better watch his 6 he will be marked for elimination
god bless him
socialism and communism destroys the very initiative in a persons heart and mind by overregulation and control its a wet soggy blanket over the fires of freedom that we need to live and be warm what the wef proposes sucks 
this man is becoming a living legend protect him there will be those that have his number
im confused this is completely against what the wef is all about
is the ai also changing the shape of his mouth to match what it is translating into english holy crap
◊õ◊ú ◊õ◊ö ◊†◊õ◊ï◊ü ◊õ◊ú ◊û◊ô◊ú◊î ◊ï◊û◊ô◊ú◊î
utter delusional and ahistorical nonsense
he is a killer god bless milei wwg1wgaww
this fella is a cooker
milei is super
one false thing he says is the wealthy will stop trying to produce if they are taxed that is false they always want more even if it is a little more dont underestimate the greed of the wealthy they will still produce even if they do not make as much because they are taxed tax the rich bastards the rest i agree with as long as we have true capitalism and not crony capitalism
amazing well said exactly correct god bless president milei
too many edits for me to take seriously  need other sources for verification
thought he gave speech in his common tongue ai
this looks fake  is it
never mind the falklands give him the entire uk and we might have a future
spitting facts
if there was ever a 2nd coming this is it 
is this real  it could be a deep fake
milei as the president of argentina should keep his lectures about argentina
javier is a fresh voice in this mad world

commonsense speech that all need to hear good man javier bravo
dont use ai to manipulate peoples speeches it does not matter if it is digitally translated word for word and in his voice this is not his voice there are plenty of translated versions stop using ai stick to the actual source for authenticity
amazing hero
there needs to be a crackdown on croney capitalism peoples disdain with capitalism stems from that being rampant also a ubi and 32 hour work week is not dependent on socialism both those policies can be implimented into a free market capitalistic society
wow
wow what a load of horse dung i cant imagine who this speech is for oh this guy got into office just last month this must be his initiation speech for his entry into the wef one of us one of us
love you boss
i feel like theres some lies and incorrectness in there listening to it it felt very deus ex world power speech about how corporate power is the true way to freedom which is not true capitalism and corporate power only leads to more abuse of those that are only seen as resources to gain profit from masses are too easily convinced of ugly fake truths
spot on
the people hes talking to know this they are just evil
i have been waiting to hear this speech since trump was robbed of the opportunity in 2020 this planet will be unlivable under the demonic socialist agenda beautiful speech humble yourselves wef use your powers to fight for what is right or cowardly cave to ideas proven to not work this push towards socialism must be rejected loudly and proudly what are great time to be alive
and to you sir the vatican sees you as a very real threat

nwoglobalistoligarchs
everyone pray for this man you know his life is in danger for daring to question and debunk those who believe they are gods they will never live what they propose for everyone but themselves
wow he oets it
when we wrap a lie in halftruths emerges from right or left to the left and right the virtuous noble lie as a trap of the ocult agreement of consent just like god is neither lefthanded nor righthanded humankind needs both hands to construct a integral society enough of this nonsense eternal war between left and right created by the fragmented consciousness and compartmentalized egoshumankind is a whole consciousness intelligence organic being 
what does he think of child labor laws and bank bailouts
i would add any maket that seeks to manipulate the market through currency our subsidies should be listed as untrustworthy and free trade should stop
what was said behind closed doors everyone has a price 
wow this is ai translation
love this dude
wow wow wow bravo yet i now fear for you sir
andava detto ben fatto  dott milei chapeau
fake controlled opposition
socialist history trumps abstract socialist ideas every time  history proves milei is correct
nice pork chops
saying this at the wef is like walking into the savoy and pissing on the floor
y they give him a filipino accent tho
more than half the white people in the comments wouldnt give a fuck if the actually heard the man speaking spanish with subtitles
finally somebody is telling the truth   bravo argentina 
i see a sovereign citizen 
subbed great offering here 
all very well but giving carte blanche to the multinational corporations is ensuring that people will not even have reasonable jobs that the natural resources of the countries will be devastated without leaving anything to the states countries from which they are extracted and worse the people will not have any right to defend themselves against megaconsortiawhat is needed is a state representative of the interests of the population at each country true democracy where the corruptive force of corporations in the political sphere is nullified and politicians make reasonable decisions that promote the common good and do not benefit the elites that milei mentions milei errs in thinking that the elites are groups separate from the megacorporations when in reality they are the owners of the latter and all the crimes that we have seen increase to scandalous levels in these last four years are caused by megacorporations controlled by the elite that owns them and that has managed to get into the pockets of every politician in every once prosperous country in other words he promises what we all want but putting the shadow of the benefit of the popular doubt on delinquent businessmenor someone is going to tell me that gates bezos and in argentina the two most powerful are white doves all the suffering that we have seen starting from the covid19 pandemic the undeclared wars the losses in pension equity funds etc all are the result of the excessive control that these billionaires exercise over the market for which there is no mechanism to stop them in effect its abuse of monopoly power has eliminated the true creative capitalist force small and mediumsized businesses since large corporations have taken it upon themselves to eliminate them using politicians and their globalist 2030 agenda to make them cease to exist true freedom will come when the excessive powers that corporations have compared to small businesses and individuals are eliminated im not saying that entrepreneurship and market freedom must be eliminated we just have to eliminate the bad elements that contaminate and destroy it from within and put reasonable limits to prevent this to happen again
argentina is in good hands
rebuilding trust is the theme of the world economic forums 2024 annual meeting in davos switzerlandtime≈ç dana≈çs et d≈çna ferentƒìsdont trust danai even when they bear gifts he is just trojan horse
the demons were squirming in their seats
this man is a man of freedom he must be protected
well spoken and so true
mine is working fine
what a breath of fresh air it says a lot about the argentinian people selecting this man as their president in a western world going bonkers they have decided to go the right way good job argentina 
for the record this man is not suicidal protect him
this guy and trump are the only 2 reasons i have hope for humanity
whyyy is this so heavily edited
love it this man will go down in the annals of history as a great great visionist and protagonist for freedomtalk about walking into the dragons lair may god protect you for conveying our message of freedom and liberty throughout the west and the world satan klaus be damned
is this an ai render or real
excellent speech mr president milei  thank you
he made many good points but unfortunately his argument assumes that gdpcapita is a good measure of economic success aka progress  prosperity and not just a gamified vanity metric that doesnt properly capture externalities or known unknowns
definitely agree with him about government interventions to the market and mostly disagree with him about that the western free market i dont think that have never been free brings the prosperity the western free market and western societies would have collapsed many times unless there had been three main things these are international interventions to periphery countries imperialism immigration and economic protectionism
todo muy bien pero darle carta blanca a las corporaciones multinacionales es asegurar que la gente no tendr√° ni trabajos razonables que los recursos naturales de los pa√≠ses ser√°n arrazados sin dejar nada a los estados pa√≠ses de d√≥nde son extra√≠dos y peor la gente no tendr√° ning√∫n derecho para poder defenderse de los megaconsorcios  lo que hace falta es un estado representativo de los intereses de la poblaci√≥n de cada pa√≠s verdadera democracia donde la fuerza corrutiva de las corporaci√≥n en la esfera pol√≠tica sea anulada y los pol√≠ticos tomen decisiones razonables que fomenten el bien com√∫n y no beneficien a las elites que milei menciona  milei yerra pensando que las elites son grupos separados de las megacorporaciones cuando en realidad son los due√±os de est√°s √∫ltimas y todos los cr√≠menes que hemos visto aumentar a niveles escandalosos en estos √∫ltimos cuatro a√±os son originados por megacorporaciones controladas por la elite que las posee y que ha logrado meterse al bolsillo a todo pol√≠tico de todo pa√≠s otrora pr√≥spero  o sea promete lo que todos queremos pero poniendo ne la sombra del beneficio de la duda popular a los empresarios delincuentes  o alguien me va a decir que gates bezos y en argentina los dos m√°s poderosos son blancas palomas  todo el sufrimiento que hemos visto partiendo por la pandemia covid19 las guerras no declaradas las p√©rdidas de patrimonio de fondos de pensiones etc todas son el resultado del control excesivo que ejercenn esto billonarios sobre el mercado para lo cual no existe un mecanismo que los detenga  en efecto su abuso de poder monop√≥lico ha eliminado a la verdadera fuerza capitalista creadora los peque√±os y medianos empresarios pues las grandes corporaciones se han encargado de eliminarlos usando a los pol√≠ticos y su agenda 2030 globalista para que dejen de existir  la verdadera libertad vendr√° cuando se eliminen los poderes execivos que tienen las corporaciones en comparaci√≥n con las peque√±as empresas y las personas naturales  no digo que hay que eliminar el emprendimiento y la libertad de mercados s√≥lo hay que eliminar a los malos elementos que la contaminan y destruyen por dentro
and all mainstream media reported not
well spoken clear  thinking and articulate
trump 20 and a genius xtrm exrmc686
the ai trick is amazing but the flow of the speech is broken in certain parts
he knows full well that hes got a huge bullseye on his backtheyll the collective of evil elites will now bring to bare their power and influence to wreck him and his freely elected government by whatever means he is speaking for the masses who dont have a voice but want prosperity a good life the ones who the elites couldnt give a rats about other than being under their influence and control the great pretenders evil personified my only issue with this speech is the significant underestimate of the human cost of the socialist experiments in the 20th century the russian experiment alone was way more than the 100million lives add in china and the rest then safely double that costnumbers viva argentina
man i love you
i want him talking in his own language not some ai that may not be exact
clank
wow thank you thank you thank you 
well said time discovers truth that was an heroic speech of absolute brilliant truth facts and evidence the truth will set you free and it also cuts like a knife thank you for your courage integrity honesty and revolutionary path to freedom liberty justice  health and world peace and happiness entrepreneurial intelligence and respect for the prosperity of others creats peace and protects the planet 
too bad he cant run for us president
whether its france to the us to the rest of the world if we fall liberty will always live on viva libertad
someone should ask what they are floating in evergreen container ships all around the world
wonderful speech
he is right about most nations being collectivist nature of all economies capitalism died long ago we all have mixed economies and the governments and central banks regulate everything
give us more  freedumbsmurca needs more corporatism 
everybody needed to hear this thank you  
now the origins of these ideas ayn rand and yaron brook
fabulous speech
question  how did this guy get away with giving this speech  does he expect to get an invitation to the wei aka our oligarch rulers forum  im pretty sure someone is going to pay a lot of money to handle this guy  hope he has good security
argentina youve got a winner here the challenges you face will be difficult i hope america changes course in 2024 revoke socialism dont let anyone tell you ambition is immoral golden
yes economic freedom and liberalism however for the common people the rich need to be taxed that is the only way to keep a balance in society something that has been lacking for the last 50 years
long live freedom damn it
phenomenal and accurate presentation and assessment of our economic present and a warning to protect our future thank you for your transparency and honesty
great show now do something for your own country argentina and yeah those people at davos dont need to feel guilty about making money 
major questionwhy did a tyrannical communist organization runt by evil billionaires invite this guy who seemingly stands against all their health and wealth crushing plans what is going on here
bureaucrats need to get out of the way  they are like treacle in the engine  just slow everything down this speaker from argentina nails it 
wow javier a libertarian in a position to make a difference argentina will be the place to live very soon this will be the freest country in the world pierre poilievre has a tall shadow to fill in canada wow thank god there will be safe haven from dangerous social engineering
she is so evil
based hes probably now got a lot of enemies now
hes got my respect
 thank you for the incredible speech  it gives me hope god bless you
one word wow
effective altruism is the poison in the veins of the naive to history  ignorant or the trojan horse of the 21st century i choose the later
there are lies damned lies and statistics
this is a well spoken thorough speech  on target
thats well up there with some of the greatest speech of all time
king 
i almost believed it was real for the first minute look carefuly at his lips eyebrows and mimics its either deepfake or a loop with motage
the argentine case shows that you cant just borrow and borrow and borrow money to get out of your problems  and capitalism is most pleased to keep loaning and loaning and loaning until they have sucked away all your value in interest payments and then finally abandon you when the loans eventually end
bravo to this brave man
sir if you were in the usa i would vote for you twice three times  or more thank  you president milei 
a true hero  finally
this guy speaks 100 true thank god hes got some power now the rest of the world take note 2024 donald trump in the usa and we are back on track
amen my brother amen
wow
i never thought i would ever see anything like this in my lifetime  the saying that a libertarian could not even get elected dog catcher has now been put to rest  i am amazed and heartened that what i have believed for most of my life is now being read to the world by the president of a country  i would have thought it would someday be an american president doing this but no it is south american one   it doesnt matter who says it it matters more that it is being said and beautifully so   up with individualism and down with collectivism  oh ayn rand did say things would have to get very bad before libertarianism could succeed and she was right
theyll try to do everything to end this man doubt it will be by fair means
governments have been involved in monitoring and regulating free market capitalism in one from or another since its inception the us may be a closer model to the one he is talking about but other western nations have embraced elements of collectivism within free market capitalism unbridled libertarianism is a myth because of the competing elements within the market competition between labour and capital is one example governments can operate as a mediating factor in this scenario and also operate as advocates and mediators  in international market disputes governments can also act as the warning bell to assume that free market growth can continue without checks and balances is like a train without any brakes hurtling towards a precipice
he shouldnt be there
sadly his words are falling on deaf ears  the elites at the wef are not interested in the world becoming better for allthey are interested in controlling it all for themselves
broke my patients boring as hell
wef made that speech for him
this is one of the best 1839  speeches regarding socialism vs capitalism i have ever heard excelent
hes basically addressing china
we are probably listening to one the last honest freedom loving speeches that will ever be permitted on planet earth if the elites have their way
yup exactly
hes a wolf in sheeps clothing im calling it now the wef wouldnt just allow anyone to win an election they plant them they planted this man to try and help regain trust its a scam
this gentlemen should run for office
absolutely loved it have heard numerous times and will listen again
great 
socialism has no problem with entrepreneurs businesses etcthe ussr had one the largest wealth and uplift of its people in modern history and it was full communism not socialism  it eventually failed because of corruption  you must have actual democracy where those in power can be fired but that is where it failedand it is also where the usa is now failing  incumbents get reelected over and over and over and over and over and over   the usa has nothing close to free market capitalismit has crony capitalism and monopoly corporations   monopoly is the death of capitalism and it is rampant in the usa  too big to fail the 2008 crisis showed how anticapitalism the usa is
i wonder if the main stream media will broadcast this speech it was the best speech ever about what wrong with the world globalist   net zero agendai am very surprised that did not switch him offlet hope our stupid government take notice  change direction on the mad green agenda that driving majority of the world population into poverty
brilliant and brave speech
bravo
he is the man of yearhas balls to these koolaide wef
ideologues like this should prove their notions in practise  especially when they preside over their own laboratoryno one can deliver freedom to another  thats just allowance
why is the video cut up it sounds like someone is editing the video to make it say what they want
our version of this is ramaswamy and trump
very well said 
what a talk
wow just wow i love this man  what a sharp mind and personality argentina protect him at all cost this man is your ticket to great future for you
who ever is putting these out is doing good
baffling argument that leaves out such obvious facts that within our free market capitalist system around 8 men have collected as much wealth as 36 billion people on earth around half the population and that when the gdp dominates the system as it does in free market capitalism it devours and destroys other forms of wealth morals spirit safety justice community for example drug and human trafficking cartels thrive they amp up gdps  wars send gdps through the roof mr melei also fails to mention that mega corporations are faithfully bailed out of bankruptcy by the working class the story of businesses that cant survive on their own going out of business is a dreama nightmare for the general public that is squeezed out of business by voracious megacompanies taking over everything metastasizing over the globe and recently space its crystal clear that elites wouldnt be proposing any kind of social adjustment if they didnt realized free market capitalism has their backs against the wall with problems the system cannot address in any effective way they became elites in the free market system so obviously like it but they see that it cant hold together much longer those who imagine material wealth is the only index of human development are prone to not seeing the catastrophes they face when the wealth goes berserk
i am in love with this man meili you are my hero
great speech
whereas youtube down scales uploads youtube by its very nature makes the lip syncing more legible by decreasing the resolution show this to any senior wearing glasses and theyll actually believe its real this ai advancement blows my mind now ill wait for ctrl alt face to place him in a rambo movie
so true
wow  im awe struckamazing and thank god for this man  we need more like him who arent afraid to stand up and speak the truth   praying this spreads like a wildfire that no one can put out
sorry monopoly taken to the extreme will always work to keep the monopoly in place and charge as much as the market will bear which is far higher compared to healthy competitionit can be a good thing to have consolidation because there is enough competition to drive research and development perfect competition does not allow room for research and development because margins are too low all energy goes into survival
awful
people cant believe the wef allowed this  this makes me even more suspicious of the wef now
at last a true leader for freedom 
there is no collectivism it is capitalism alright just dressed up as concerned for citizens socialism    ask yourselves who runs the world davos is a theater for our  his speech statistics is nonsensethey let him say it  because it is actually staus quo  
wow im really impressed
excellent but a few years too latethey have infaltrators in all our parliaments and wont be going anyware soon
what did kier starmer say after visiting the wef it is better than westminister where everybody agrees with everybody else when starmer left the wef he was clutching his orders and on his return to the uk he announced labour policy change and the new  policies he announced were straight from the wef and they mirrored the policies the wef rishi sunak is a wef young leader and everthing does fall into what the wef dictates sunak is happy for starmer to be the next pm because he will be passing on the mantle to a fellow wef believer and policy pusher on the board of the wef is larry finks of black rock who owns vangaurd between the two companies they own 8 trillion dollars of global assets and most of the world media companies they use those the media companies to call anybody who questions the wef plans for man an conspiracy theorists  to make them like they are mad and wears a tin foil hate i would say 80 of the global population have no idea how they are munipulated to think how the wef want them to think by media channels and news channels  and via television programmes it is a slow programming they have found a new way and that is to indoctrinate from the first day a child starts school it is no accident how the woke culture is taught in our schools from transgender to everybody who decides to leave their 3rd world country is a refugee mass immigration that is happening in europe and the us is planned and paid for by an unknown group i bet it is a group linked to the wef and un
milel fails to mention eu cow farts
when i tell a friend or coworker about klaus schwab they look at me with big eyes because they dont know anything about him the sheeps are still sleeping
every good socialist needs to be a good capitalist first so he can fund keeping people safe enough to turn them into value creating individualsthe country did not balance socialism and capitalism well and therefore it failed free competition without state intervention turns into a bunch of competitors cohering together and deciding they should work together on ripping off their costumers
it is just insane what ai is doing now kinda scary too tbh part of me doesnt know for certain if i trust this isnt manipulated and disinformation
very true all of us who have lived communism know that is what the elites are trying to bring to all they enrich themselves at the expense of humanity they will eat the best travel posses property and wont practice what they preach we will be without freedom no property money food medicine and full control of tyrants one will not even have rights over our kids he is talking truth communism is evil and enslaved humanity learn from history
spot on
moving to argentina is becoming a serious option  as opposed to staying in europe delving ever deeper into the world of prepper videos on youtube
banger
what a boss 
this man cant speak english he had a translator but his lips are sinked  great ai ill play the 2 videos back to back  listen if the words  context is the samethis is scary how many fake news will be created  
not sure who he is trying to impress he systematically shut off india china and the brics while proceed to lecture the west that he had latched on to with whom hes relying on to save argentina not too smart
how to bring the gap between persons who agree with him and those who do not
rip democracy freedom  rights in kanadamy family fought in both wars for nothing
thats world president caliber
bless him 
ai  we wont know whos actually doing the talking there is obvious editing on this video what was cut out which words were changed  yes pretty words but can it be trusted
viva javier milei su excelencia el presidente de la rep√∫blica argentina queremos libertad maldita sea viva el h√©roe

this is heavily edited
how much mercury do i need to drink to buy this drivel
this gentleman 100 gets it far smarter and more beneficial than the current us president
yes   indeed 
mucho gracias senior presidente
i  this man and im straight  
well done and well said finally people are standing up to these nutters 
1812 holy hit this is powerfull
the elitist system is based on inverted perception fantasies generated in babylon by corrupt priests the rights of the individual to make any free choices that dont conflict with the rights of another must be the basis of the modern existence minority group entitlement over the individual must be abolished their exclusive rules making to benefit themselves at the expense of the masses and the integrity of gaia
i only have bad things to say about this guy he doesnt seem to understand how much vulture capitalism and exploitation there is in america and  how unbalanced the wealth is in this country
what a brilliant mind 
excellent
it is as impossible to provide an example of free capitalism as it is to provide an example of socialism
he is dead right now im sure all of the wef hate what he is saying hope trump is taking notes as well as every american and the world
bravo mr president
it would be wonderful if corporations had the well being of people at heart
nobody elected theses people they are just hijacking all power to bring about total control and a world of slavery and division
respect 
there is an ongoing market failure right now  with the pathetic batteries on the pathetic evs which take hours and hours and hours to charge up        there was no proper testing or proving the impractical battery situations  except in recent cold weather  and now those people regret how they were deceived      a replacement battery was  47000 for one of these cars  
sounds like a french version of trump lmao
why havent the bbc covered this any msm for that matter seems to me he is a real leader with the backbone and brains to say the truth well done to him
horrible editing sounds cherry picked
this is real
for those who dont know him all  the information that hes speaking is based on empirical evidence he worked for many years as a professor of economic theory i  ii
the speech was great the translation was garbage though ai shouldnt ever be used in a political matter
this is a doctored video thumbs down
outstanding  bravo
the world is heading towards ww3 and poverty is rampant especially in the most advanced capitalist countries where are there homeless populations and disease more than in the free enterprise countries
i can not think our pm in the uk would come out with a speech like this not clever enough
all men may be created equal but apparently women arent
what a great speaker i love his talking points keep on keeping on javier
i want who wrote his speech praise that brain behind it 
he is speaking to people who believe in capitalism just like he does this is a huge nothing burger
finally someone with common sense 
we need you in greece body
truth is always beautiful  thank you
not really a quality deepfake  the skips and breaks in the video and audio give it away  the mouth movements arent 12 bad though
think we find in market economy if a company goes broke they get bailed out privatize profit socialise debt model
he is not wrong i try more if i know i wont be punished for everything i did it also true that almost all startups fail it does not help that the government punish anyone that is trying
dont listen what he says take notice what he do thats not great at all
great words
freedom is capitalism communism is slavery to the state  one of the greatest speeches on the subject  i would have liked to see the models used include inflation though growth measured without adjusting for inflation will be off
yeah the majority of american do so well in that system as do others in other free market countries not the minority do due to greed you need a mix socialism for building the roads and infrastructure providing health and services and capitalism for everything else but greed always gets its way and the capitalists move in on health and care etc that is were the whole thing falls apart yin and yang balance there should be no poor people in america yet there are millions there who are worse off than some third world countrys how many in america and the uk ect are struggling to live whilst the top 5 have so much they dont even know what to do with it they wont invest in anything unless its a sure return were is the risk taking and thoughts for others around them the rich in the west are lost in a big way they also seem to forget they never got as rich as they are on their own
this speech will mean whatever the listener wants it to mean
at this moment i wish i were argentina
using ai to change is mouth and make it look like he some english is disgusting stop it
and thats that in a nut shell peoplegood job mr milei
chunky must have been 
all that wealth over the bodies of indigenous people was very rich of us all i trust him
just to clarify he spoke in spanish ai translation makes him sounds like an indian
uh oh      he said the  f  word        f r e e d o m   
thomas sowell would be proud 
ai is going to take translators out of business  this translation proves it  milei cant speak english this clearly  i speak as a spanishenglish interpretertranslator
ddr residents can witness this as well pretty well

well said bravo
i hope he doesnt suffer some sudden misfortune
and they look at him like hes t he dumb guy
controversial abortion rights so we should have more freedom but not that freedom thats a tad hypocritical
ok and the difference between this guy and schwabb would be same shit new puppet
go milei  liberdad carajo
let freedom ring this man is now my favorite politician in a world beset by marxist snakes and globalist fools
the best is yet to come
values of the western  this fool does not know that he is a leader of a 3rd world country   
wont be long before he is cancelled
hell yeah extremely well said

viva mileiviva  argentinaviva la libertad
hero
how does he know my government so well
ik moet het nog zien laat hem eerst maar in argentini√´  de boel rechtzetten   maar hij zegt het wel goed
wow 553 thumbs down
perfect
what countries and who is this speech aimed at i felt like it was aimed at the us we control our markets using the fed and are no longer attached to the gold standard we have bailed out our banks and failed businesses which is essentially socialism we are effectively propping up our own economy while others suffer is this not what he is saying i honestly dont know so hoping people can chime in and let me know your thoughts
fantastic speach sir
this is completely incorrect capitalism has simultaneously uplifted and enslaved humanity capitalism must be abandoned if we are going to survive and grow as a species on this planet and beyond this speech is going to lead us nowhere but into ruin
poverty is happening here in australia our rights and democracy is eroding
argentinos les envidio tienen un presidente inteligente objetivo progresista y pro naci√≥n y con los huevos bien puestos para poner los hechos del fracaso socialista en el mundo lo amo
print it out and frame it
he not gone be involved again 
he part of it they make out there against wef then they help push there policies on to the people
thank god someone speaking the truth
the wef is rot of all problems in this world they have been pushing this ridiculous woke agenda and climate changes for years get out of our lives and let us live free
you ppl are finished nwo is dead
i wonder if obama wrote this speech for him
this man is a pleasant surprise
here here
argentinians i envy  you all you have a tenacious realistic intelligent president with the balls to speak with facts and without fear before a forum of socialist hypocrites
hear hear
this man is awesome
we need more leaders like him sometimes this cannot be achieved passively
imagine that the argentinian president teaching the world economy d
actually im quite impressed by his english
an educated economist is a president i wish he was our president i wish he stayed long enough to remember the world what freedom and free markets are
presidente milei a brilliant and courageous leader directly in the wicked arrogant ignorant faces of davos delitists muchas gracias presidente milei 
little trump make argentina great again
the great reset is coming people  own nothing be happy 
i thought the wef only allows people under their control to be heard unless this is a smoke screen
the snake speaks to in the vipers den yes his words are great but watch his actions and friends are the oppositehis first travel was to ny where he visited the chabad hq where they just found what in tunnels and met up with jepsteins pal bill cigar clinton then goes to meet these creeps at the wefwhy did they let him speak there because they know they are in trouble with their agenda they need controlled opposition to placate the masseswatch what he does not what he says
a leader
wait did he close his speech with long live freedom dammit 
the virtuous noble lie of capitalism identify and differentiate the left from the right to integrate and transcend the right and the left real communism is the dialectic relationship between right and left if there are sectors to private there are others to collective the capitalist mind says the ends justify the means everything has a price sell me your soul and i will give you the world divide to conquer the communist mind says the means always determine the ends everything has a value achieve sovereignty and you will conquer the greater being unite to evolve and for those who say capitalism is natural  yeeesss capitalism is as natural as viruses are natural and contagious  communism is organic and requires sovereign beings to recognise nobody is an island as we all are parts like spheres that include and transcend spheres that integrate spheres of a whole consciousness intelligence organic being as holarchies the universe is not a hierarchical pyramid of mathematic quantities the universe is a holarchy of spheres of consciousness qualities   
i do hope it is not just steam allowed to give relief and air to the pressure they can then say they listen is it just a pressure valve
absolutely beautiful 
honest person
cudoes to javier milei for his courage  the president of the heritage foundation kevin roberts also demonstrated amazing courage and patriotisism in his spelling out of the fake and destructive agenda of the wef are we not noticing a strange new wind  sort of an earthquake  not to worry folksits just the nwo new world order folks changing course to perhaps remain relevantbelievable alive even  politicians own many coats one of sheap one of wolf one of snake isnt it amazing to have so many coats for any weather  well well  more or less slowly the msm main stream media will converge towards approval of trumpbecause they will have no choice  they will die or change course and in the process have to forfeit the billions of dollars poured into their cashboxes by the soros the gates and others of the deep state with their 2030 agenda of destroying the usa  the world 
javier get a food tester when your at the wef next time
is this real or a deep fake  the message is true and makes you think about argentina
yes
thats interesting as one of the highest gdp countries per capita in the world are very socially democratic full market capitalism has huge flaws but if thats what the people of argentina want then go ahead you will soon find out why it doesnt work
correlation is not causation the stork population of europe has declined as much as the birth rate
although i agree with essentially everything he said im surprised excessive currency printing wasnt mentioned  i spose its essentially another form of government overreach 
agree with most but i certainly feel the economy come in a hard second to earth my kids and theirs being my reasoning if you can name a water source other than pre industrial ice that isnt polluted ill take my statement back
im a  and after listening to this im in tears from the truth we know and you speak your country is absolutely graced to have you i can only hope for my grandchildren they will live a free and happy life
libertarianism and socialism is whats destroying this country right now the libertarian socialist who have insurance their self in the united states government everything you see going on thats going wrong in our country today is caused by libertarian socialism
you would think the wef would consider this speech and regroup like grown ups setting an example for our youth tell the truth respond and discuss he has stats he makes sense and he is for the people
capitalism requires reproduction which it penalizes families for and drops the birth rate to near zero to replace these future generations we depend on immigrants often from countries with better social programs or from war torn countries being invaded by more capitalistic ones or victims of unfair trade agreements
hope that these are the true  world leaders  who gonna save  the world from the devilswefwho
great
1550
lol  a crazy anarchocapitalist trying to lecture the wef which is a capitalist collectivist cabal who want to run humanity into a digital dystopiacapitalism will eat itself and socialsm and communism will prevail rising from the ruins of capitalism
its safe to say that he wont be invited back 
he didnt kill himself
i would love to hear what whitney webb has to say about this
the wef needs to be classified  as a terrorist  organization
it is the morans in the usa government which has been placed into office and are the reggime that is deceiving its people corruption has overwhelmed us to the point where it has been accepted as a new normthe people must standup to this reggime and remove them from office it may even start a civil war burt is better than the wars we see now never has there been such a weak leader to allow this to happenmoney can buy you anything even a government you are a traiitor brandonand so is your staff
lmfao 
talk is cheap lets see how his policies turn around argentinas economy in the coming years and if the poverty rate goes up or down
wowi see that all the mega corporations will love you big timeonly problem is the superior product often kills people  but heyother people be damned right 
strange my internet never broke
love it respect freedom everything else will fall in its rightful place thank you mr president
this guy talks like he has fallen out from atlas shrugged finally one sane politician on this planet
my lord and my god finally a leader who knows believes and speaks the truth
ai is bs no big deal
sir it was fern√°ndez de kirchner who bankrupted your country
thank you for posting
we are in trouble the wef and schwab were always supposed to be the sacrificial lamb of the nwo and they knew it and played their role too seriously dont fall for it we must come up with our own planthis is part of their plan
1358 1406 the cornerstone of our great states that  does the argentine guiding document state that as the u s guiding document does  interesting
if he can save argentinas economy then i will revisit his words right now he is nobody a candidate for change basically
milei is brilliant i hope the best for argentina and hope the united states politicians from towns to congress senate and president not only hears his words but listens and acts
this is the best speech i have ever heard amazing
they dont carethey are doing these evils in the open now
its one thing to translate its another to change his mouth to form words in english  ai is beyond scary
correct on all countswe are all blessed by his courage to bring this message to such an elitist gatheringperhaps there is hope that the brilliance of the human spirit can shine through the gathering darkness
now he is a leader
my internet is working fine
this man is the first leader ever heard  in my lifetime that wants to do what the world really needs to make this world a place worth living in for all humanity the whole world should support him and pray for him 
i thought he a jackass turning his country upside down to please western now china gonna inviting him to visit beijing
the man knows  speaks the facts best wishes to him  argentina
talk is cheaplets see what he actually does
socialism is rooted in jealousy not collectivism
i have a feeling that him and another guy  cant remember his name but also opposes the wef were invited there on purpose if these guys speak we relax and do nothing its their psycho way of gaining our trust
bravo thank you dont let these people change you look at biden obamas  soros karey  harris ect wicked  people  doing wicked things
his words mean jack shit until he manages to turn around argentinas economy until then he is a nobody
this is argentinas trump 
javier you the man who walks into a lions den and tells the lions need a bath
data doesnt lie
do i see another bukele on deck  i hope so
this man knows first hand the danger of radical socialism and communism which has destroyed his country it killed over 100 million people throughout the twentieth century he understands that centralised authoritarian control by the woke illiberal elites is equally dangerous
wef is the most capitalist organization ever
the lord jesus crist will always protect his flock
great in theory but cheating s indemic
thank you argentina forever strong
another leader who can actually read the room is that 2 now trump 2024
truth
algunos comentarios ejemplifican el espiritu destructivo de los colectivistas  en argentina a 40 dias de su asunci√≥n los sindicatos convocan un paro general  no aceptan que otros hagan prosperar un pais que √©llos depredaron  vllc
yeah man  austin powers dont play  except with chainsaws
ron paul 20
bravo this needs to be addressed more there are better solutions
klaus schwab just choked on his catwow javier nailed the globalist cabals collective arses to the wallway to go bravo javier
i love the factual clear undeniable presentation thank you we need more intelligent knowledgeable and brave voices like his they are trying to silence people like him
shared  please share this important video as widely as possible folks
when nixon stopped backing the us dollar with gold then we had just an imaginary dollar with no limit to the amount and no cost for the elite to create them willynilly we need an honest international money not controlled by any politicians or governments
fu8k yeah
only 5 live in poverty globally this guy is out to lunch
trump syndrome without the derangement 
im surprise how easy people fool by a superficial speech i count about 20 l√≠es on milei speech
genius enough said
i agree 100
man i llllooooove this guy his idealism is purely based on factsstats legit afedit 15 mins in ill move to argentiniaedit 2 argentina is my unconditional ally from today on
i cant think of anything civil or respectful to say about ol schwab tho
great speech great man wow i want to move to argentina
awesome more brave country leaders need to speak out
so is he claiming that todays worlds economic system along with all its economic and financial institutions is a form of socialism not capitalism and blaming everything on socialism hes such a joke along with his fans lol
bravo 
sounds like they let a trojan horse sneak in
only if we in india could bring this sense to our governments
i like this guy thank you people of argentina
big respect
im a fan respect for this man rare person who speaks the truth
thousand likes from me for this mister
referring to the monopoly look at all the conglomerates of mega corporations who buy and sell other major corporations monopolies are illegal in western countries yet only a handful of corporations own the entire gdp of the most wealthiest country in the world also keep in mind the extremely small few board members of those companies dont get me started on world banks
my internet is working fine
what happens when he has kids no time clock to punch for motherhood so i dont see how liberalism brings equality to women unless child bearing and rearing is a luxury for those who can hire surrogates and nannies working people being incubators for the rich instead of having their own kids so i guess this is equality for men and women under a capitalist society
i wish this man was the usa leader
his numbers are utterly bogus he starts off suggesting only 10 of people live in poverty in fact almost 50 of the people in the world live in poverty around 10 live in absolute poverty he does finally get round to admitting that halfway through this nonsense hes thoroughly disingenuous he isnt there on behalf of the people of argentina thats for sure he wants to enrich only himself
actually sounds like the teacher on peanuts not his voice just the content lol i think a monarchy would be good for us and if we were all on the same side that could help does anyone really need to harm another to be happy
it sounds robotic is it really he talking
oh my god somebody who is taking a stand against the world economic forum hooray for you and for all of us thank you
i like this man
i love what this man is saying  god bless this man
fantastic 
wow argentina  is waking up
he is good  but greatewst failure of not understanding humanities impat upo nature  our life supprt system is in meltdown  and we cant surfive what is coming  there will be bo trade  only warand famine
selling advertising is profitable selling weapons fraud politics trade medicine and selling drugs is too let us all do those things and leave production work and services to the stupid people
stupid ai hacks off entire sentences
what a breath of fresh air i guess we will have to wait until we are as much of a basket case as argentina before finding our own javier milei  trump talks the talk but this guy walks the walk
this dude is on fire
samm√°la hverju or√∞i
i hope the argentine people willl support him and not the dumb socialist members in argentina
amen
couldnt have said it better my self
is he still alive did they let him leave after this
what a legend
why did you join usa then
i mostly agree with this strange dude except his insight on the regulation of monopoly different socioeconomic models have cons and pros so far free market is one of the most effective models but it has achilles spots and the tendency to monopolization is one of such weaknesses it eventually renders freemarket to become to be nonfree market so antimonopoly regulation is required to fix it but any regulation contradicts freemarket such inconsistency of a pure freemarket model can be resolved and it has been resolved in usa by slight modification of free market model from the middle   of 1930ths by antimonopoly acts but even an earlier version of freemarket had such regulation the sherman antitrust act
legend this man said what millions are thinking swaub and his lefties must be turning purple on hearing this speechwhat we need is a counter movement that premotes free speech and self improvement and less interference by the state and its cronies like soros and gatesi hope we hear more from this leader with a backbone
sounds great but i still want to give anarchy a try first no rulers people would also have to give up the usury system diy sets you free nobody gives it to you
frikkin boss love this guy
i will ask him when he gets older in a world where everyone is selling bitcoins and trading stocks to get rich where everyone is making videos and selling advertising when the statistics show a very peachy numbers for the poor who is going to take care of his ailing body i am sure the doctors guided by economic principles will wipe clean his bank account and leave him decrepit and penniless 
this guy can barely scrape the rule of the bilderberg meeting regulars hes small fly
life liberty and property busybodies leave us be
another globalists puppet and peasants are cheering
he is a hockey stick
the best speech i have ever heard that has came out of this organization he spoke facts
 wowza 
not all heroes wear capes wow
how come that the comity allowed him to speak up well speechwe know that in eu  they will call him nazionalist
extraordinary its like the works of adam smith and thomas sowell were distilled into a 10 minute speech great job dubbing  makes this explosion of commonsense easily accessible
its a speech the world needed to hear thank you mr milei
lets pray they listen to his warning and wake up
i loved the fact they are being given a reality check by the president of argentina that is also an economist  it was a truly great speech they all needed to hear capitalism brought more people out of poverty in the shortest time period than any other economic system in the world
thats a terrible shame there is a man giving a speech to what equates to a forum of drug cartel leaders that only care about gaining in their own wealth and telling them abiding by the laws and helping humanity its a good thing trump told the same group of one world control fanatics basically the same thing and they have been trying to get rid of him with the crooked party in control of america ever since sounds like another man interested in the wellbeing of the humanity and the little guy just put him self in the cross hairs of the wefs self serving power players god protect these people
this is why we have the right to bear arms
well wef eletists is the enemy this guy is brilliant and has to backbone to stand up
i have opposed most politicians javier milei is a hero  now lets see if he can execute his vision bravo  blessings and all the best champion for free markets
that was an awesome and inspiring speech
what kind of system should it be sweden usa or china
this guy is maga material thank you
excellent
in 500 years socialists will complain their spaceships arent as nice as the trillionaires spaceyachts
fantastoc
the sad thing is that so few people understand this despite the overwhelming evidence that capitalism delivers prosperity freedom and digntiy to everyone
anyone who attends this place  apart from this guy has got some serious moral issues
this video is definitely edited you can hear the glitches in it
the argentinian trump  god bless you long life to you president miley 
way to go argentina a leader for the world to admire
preaching the truth
best translator for him almost seems like it is him speaking english
hes 100 percent correct
amen and amen
everybody here seems to have completely forgotten or are conveniently ignoring the fact that tesla and spacex wouldnt exist without significant financial support from the us government in their early years now they can largely stand on their own but are still receiving lots of government money from various programs if you follow this guys hardline libertarianism musklike companies would never get off the ground because of barriers to entry that are insurmountable without help from the collective mixed economies work bestproblems arise with the consolidation of wealth and power we are trending toward or have already arrived at corporate state fascism western state governments predominantly serve corporate state interests like with the military industrial complex and big pharma
his conclusions may seem logical but he is confused the reason for decline is not the economic system capitalism vs communism it is the corruption corruption in government and corruption of the idea of both capitalism and socialism the countries of big economic growth are those where the corruption is at a minimum where the politicians and the government leave something for the country they dont take absolutely everything and more
wonderful
whats wrong with his mouth is it ai generated
this guys speech  might of just give canada a chance of revitalisation  hope to final recovery  after trudeaus departure  the desintegration of the wef  bravo 
the most watched but least listened to speech
we must remember  learn from past  presentthat true free market capitalism includes responsibility fordamages it creates while advancing and efficient honest regulatory bodieshowever as it is in current free marketsuccesses of 1 of the wealthiestis achieved through abusing  taking wealth from middle  lower income population unless these mega corporations are correctlyhonestly held to account  regulatedwe all lose except the 1 wealthiest  for many decades governments such as the usa et alhave allowed corruption  protection of these mega corporations to monopolize  own markets while not being accountable to the people they damage the laws are overlooked or changed by influential lobbies severely corrupted regulatory agencieswho have become their croniescorporate cronyism now rules many western democraciesgovernment officials are bought  this is not true market capitalism but falseand will be the downfall of democracies  includes pharma medical systems agriculture energy  weaponizing climate changes  military industrial complex banking housing  many others
no hell no farzad while on the surface javiers screed hits many of the libertarian hot buttons many of which i agree with its critical to put this speech in context this is the speech that the pirates will make just before picking your pockets and throwing you overboard to the sharksmilei uses gross generalities such as comparing abortion rights to a socialist form of population control positioning all competing political groupsphilosophies as parasitic soul sucking bureaucrats compared to his vision of a benevolent and perfect meritocracy of idealistic entrepreneurs this is reminiscent of ayn rands juvenile nonsense consider the absolutely critical inflection point the 2024 election represents we are in the early stages of the four biggest societal transformations weve ever experienced transportation energy labor and food hat tip adam dorrs brighter as we go through these transitions our society will necessarily go through some very difficult times as we are forced to abandon old ways of managing ourselves and adopt innovative  and previously unacceptable  new ways forward we have two political paths to choose from this year to get us through this difficult beginning on the democratic side we have a deep and wide bench of mostly well intentioned and capable public servants in the last three years inflation has essentially been tamed no high prices arent inflation they are the result of past inflation unemployment is very low massive investments are being made in supporting renewable energy expansion of evs and charging networks fighting climate change domestic production of microchips basic infrastructure fixes rebuilding of global alliances decisive and strong support for ukraine israel and nato and an absolute commitment to personal reproductive rights and our constitutionallybased government you dont like biden fine hell be gone before or no later than the 2028 elections our democracy is designed to refresh itself through election cycles dont like something get engaged vote run for office and make changes within our systemon the other side of the aisle is the gop which has completely transformed into maga of which their bench is one person wide and deep and his intended legislative positions and historical record are literally the opposite of all the evidence and positions mentioned above and this wont be good for long term business if we in the teslaelon universe can put aside our short term frustrations with bidens unhinged prounion mary barra fluffing words and focus on the actions and legislation that have actually occurred the choice becomes much clearer we can abandon our constitutional republic and go with the knownothing prima donna narcissistic fascist cowboy or support and force change from within the progressive evidencebased forward thinking democratic party
lets me honest herei have no idea how capitalism socialism communism collectivism or any of those words are defined or what the subtle differences between them are or how they interconnect ive never heard a single explanation of any of them and i certainly wasnt taught about them at any pointi was just told we have the best economic system in much the same way that i was told we have the best football teamam i alone in this how many of you are scholars who actually have a deep understanding of these topicscause i get the feeling me and all of you are just blandly watch people argue about things we can barely even understandin fact i need a new hobby ima go start learning about it
wonder who wrote his speech  so the previous government didnt believe in the right to property and a free market economy  he seems to love the west more than latin america  i wonder why  is it because argentinians are really europeans and not south americans
yall better get on board with  milei token its on ethereum its going to 1 dollar went from 1 cent to 15 overnight now at 7 cents bullish momentum im tellin u milei token dude
finnally a leader worth following this man does not lie
the leftists believe that you have no right to exist for your own sake they believe that you exist for the sake of the state and collective this is the fundamental principle they want to indoctrinate into your kids
dont trust someone talk about freedom and money and support us and israel
lord milei 
freedom presidente milei  our truth hero 
marvelous
remember their names and faces
man hasnt heard of inflation lol
hes bad ass
amen 
1 compensation is not always commensurate with contribution 2 the principle of nonaggression is incompatible with a competitive capitalist society and with human nature itself 3 an unchecked monopoly would wheeled as much power for corrosion through violence as the mightiest of states 4 humans do cause harm to the environment i generally agree with his sentiment and truly enjoyed this speech claims to the contrary above however make his argument weaker  anyone who is collectivist leaning can use any one of these points to completely dismiss his argument
awesome speech
a great man
no it didnt
this is one of the most important and timely speeches ever unfortunately however im wonder how many deaf ears this message fell on far too many i fear this message is on par with rush limbaughs message on americas exceptionalism
bravo at last someone with a sound mind
absolute truth the beauty of speaking with power uncorrupted
if the natural tendencies of mankind are so bad that it is not safe to permit people to be free how is it that the tendencies of these organizers are always good do not the legislators and their appointed agents also belong to the human race or do they believe that they themselves are made of a finer clay than the rest of mankindfrederic bastiat¬†the law
big brother had him come and speak to the ministry of plenty so they can say see were not evil as brouhaha followed the speech
where can i vote for this guy in the uk
and there you have it folks  salute milei
thankyou sir
the man who speaks to you of sacrifice speaks of slaves and masters and intends to be the masterayn rand
eh ipredictionsgit a bananapokeame na
benny hill 20
its trump wo the bravado well spoken and focused
well spoken truth will prevail
its about time someone explained the reality through statistics  but the wef has to be aware of that theyre successful business people  so why do they persist in their folly  because socialism communism puts complete control in their hands and takes all control both business and personal out of the individuals hands  all in the manipulative guise of equity
well put no doubt but to save 19 minutes of ones time  its on capitalism is good socialism is bad  thats the pointthen there is contrast and compare some historical data based on argentina  defense of libertarian principles and free market capitalismthats his viewtygot it
what a dude
but can he deliver success in argentinatalk is cheap 
an earthquake is happening in argentina that will shake up nations
these are wordssee words workwork wordswork
i agree with much this man is saying i hope however he agrees that the top 10 should also be paying their share in taxes so that the rest are not carrying the whole burden that top 10 makes as much as the 90 in the world and that is insane
god bless argentina stand up for not only your country but the whole west and all its peoples mr milei love from american 19 year old
wow
woooowlong live freedom
no argument left for socialism
think what two men farzad and president trump could do together
chicago illinois here i love this guy why cant he be my president how do i get my haircut like that
i am on the fence with this man till he actually does something
north america needs to pay attention
careful now if it sounds too good to be true  then it probably is even a child knows many a lie is cloaked in truth 
i remember when trump went up and said very similar things in front of this group and they didnt stop him until he got home i think we need to pray for this wonderful man and hope and pray that he does connect with trump so he can help him to overcome the obstacles hes going to be facing another person who should connect with is bibi nathanyahusame caliber of a manmay the lord bless you se√±or millei
whats with all the jump cuts
one of the most important speeches of our time
wonderful
wow the world needs people like him
i hope this man is well protected these davos people dont like the truth
what is klaus reactioni wonder
common sense increasingly less common
 can you run the united kingdom after you have fixed argentina
it broke the internet with 14000   political theater  be wary
leftist believe so many myths and lies they do not want to hear this truth
absolutely brilliant he probably wont be invited next year
truth always outsbravo
this guy has brains 
bill gates is thinking  their on to me
omfg he sounds like trump lmao
that ai engine is pretty good
modern ronald reagan
i heard the speech in spanish it is translated exactly 
lord whatever trap that the wef is planning for the innocent may the wickeds own feet get caught in the trap instead and may the innocent go free in the name of jesus amen
why is the video glitching
not only did ai do his voice and words on engish ai also changed his lip movements to match what was saidthere will be a few speakers to never be invited back  javier milei is one of them and his page on the wef might get removed unless this is a doublebluff
it would be better if the speech wasnt incomplete and incoherent show the real speech  it was so much better
he diplomaticly told wef to f off
wow this is the march for us the people
farzyness i saw it is pinned by farzad and im like huh i didnt do it and then i see the channel thats my nickname
chemtrails
hats off to wef for allowing this speech we need this in universities opening minds hearing the other view
editor please take care that any cuts for brevity dont remove details dates or statistic data thank you for this video this was a very important speech this man understands economic freedom and markets in general he gets socialism and its detrimental impacts on humanity the limitations of human rights and its devolvement into fascism i hope he survives after this slap in the face of the wef and their masters i wish american had someone of his courage someone who could bring us out of our flirting with socialism and bureaucratic weaponized politicsif only
awesome speech from president javier milei he is absolutely right there are no market failures if that happens its because someone intentionally wanted it to fail or because something was very wrong in that market  long life freedom damn it this man is a genius
if you find yourself opposing what this man said  then something is wrong he is so blatantly and obviously correct that only someone with bad intentions could oppose him why anyone would want to inflict the nightmare of collectivism onto their fellow citizens is disturbing and difficult to understand unless their intentions are evil  the fact that we are still debating this is insane
im hopeful hearing this speech at the world elitist forum all they are is descendants of  royalty from generations of wealth ignorance and inbreeding of bloodlines
bravo standing ovation
god bless this man argentina you are very lucky
i would like to hear claus and john carey comment on this incredible speech
capitalism worldwide is poverty hunger desperation   homelessness  destitution  yet socialism is the problem
this man should get a standing ovation 
bravo 
pay attention to the economic truthan economic system of the people for the people  by the peoplethe state is indeed the problem
viva argentina
cut budgets of over paid subsidized bureaucrats
why isnt joe biden there word on the street is that isnt the real joe biden
the wef actually let him say all that wow they just got stomped i doubt they invite him back 
the book  the 5000 year leap addresses this  great read
the best speech this year everybody should listen to this across the globe
never underestimate a man who seems eccentric nothing wrong with it their usually honest intellugentcandcwont stab you in the back
it keeps jumping
i wish you was made in britain sir we could use someone like you
genio sr presidente es un orgullo para nuestro pais
i thank god for people like him
colonelresearch sabc to find our preisident has recently reported
hope he doesnt know the klintons
guy starts by supporting his point with some ancient story about argentina being a global power yes a bunch of europeans came and took over the land started exploiting it and made a bunch of money that doesnt mean argentina was an advanced economy for the the times but yes an extraction one many countries still do that for instance russia advanced economy nah
what a powerful speech  too bad few people will ever get to hear it
he speaks the truth how refreshing
just imaginenif all the presidents and pm were like him and trump and rfk and decsantis abd vicek what a lovely safe workd we would have
western elite media msm is pushing this all over the world which means this guy is cringe and they are promoting this for a reason that has nothing to do with serving the public socialism pulled most latin americans out of poverty this guy represents oligarchs chased out for theft and criminal behavior during peoples revolutions across the region which were black indigenous and socialist and raised 80 of the poor from those groups from abject poverty after rubber barons like this guy robbed them and kept them in poverty  this guy is the elite more gaslighting from supercapitalists as capitalism collapses around the world this speech didnt break the internet its one of the lamest most predictable slack jobs i have ever heard try harder though i like the shock bots in comments  lol
i cant trust a speech that is this chopped up
he is absolutely  correct
too many subsidized womens studies professors who are subsidized and only speak half the truth excluding men collectivists destroy truth by excluding the whole truth collectivists destroy the truth with quotas and agendas mandates tragic subsidized failures like public education public education must be privatized
do not sell your national wealth to wall street for some paper money  dont be a fool
did he talked in spanish or english  i saw this in spanish
ai his do they make his mouth match english
finally a guy who knows whats going on
the future which us wall street money men will buy off all argentine national resources land and mines including lithium with paper money  some people will definitely benefits from the sell off but every citizen in argentina will lose in the long runit is equivalent to a village leader sell all the land to a rich man and everyone in the village becomes the serf for that rich man
this is  john galts speech from ayn rands atlas shrugged   
does business there say wages are socialism too  check those taxpayer subsidies to business too  on low wages 50 years from now half of your people wont be able to afford credit  the rules of which business writes because campaign contributions are regulated by the fox i mean irs  look up dark money on wikipedia and pay attention to 501c4
wow what a man real balls
clickbait the internet is working well
the reason why they let this man speak and occasionally others like him its to show the rest of the globalist elites who the enemy is they also use opportunities like this to let this man mix and mingle with the elites present and they hope certain things will rub off and he can be converted or at the very least tamed
i wish this brilliant person was the president of south africa just imagine the country and its citizens  it would be a paradise of the people
this is what the wef should structure themselves with freedom capitalism less government and more people
how is working and making things for profit unfair thats a question for the left being productive is in fact penalized by a progressive and insanely complicated tax code that demoralise people into poverty and apathy the left is evil
ok he is positive as a balance of ideas but capitalism also started with negative things  as slavery child labor colonialism etc and  it created socialism as a response  it required a framework to be sustainable and clashed with democracy so it created the problem the state and its regulations  now we have monopolies and environmental problems  notice china found a solution to all that by removing democracy from the equation and capitalism seems to be working good there and that makes more complex the dilemma for the west so my point is that milei perspective is too local and partial since he is an economist and i dont think an economist should run a country alone he is perfect for the current argentine situation though
bravo 
just look at america and its issues to see the flaws of capitalism however i do aspire with libertarianism but we need some simple laws to enforce an apple to use usbc or prevent all jobs to be relocated to cheaper countries where people do starve to make a living i mean whats the point of wealth if you can only archive that over the suffering of others i rather see the tide lift all boats even foreign
brilliant speech thank you wef take note listen more and less ballsit
an excellent world leader
why would any of you support the morally bankrupt policies of the selfonlyinterested who have created extreme inequalities in wealth and basic security
wow parasites  the name for those who refuse to use wisdom making him look and sound foolish from a rag news feed shows how planted they are in what he argued against 1192024
he is just another clown 
if this man was the head of the who we either wouldnt have had covid at all or would have at least been given vitamin d and ivamectin
thank you president milei thank you argentina for electing him
thats a wonderful speech but we dont have a free market
this speech should be in every school and college in america and europe great speech
more peacful d
capitalism where essential services are valued less than each and every member of your favorite football team and the millitary donates millions to esports where 12 nerds can go toe to toe while the backbone of your economy starves to death where the presidents are sstrade owners and our troops either violate the women or violate their government instead capitalism is so great that slavery is more lucrative than ever before and sweatshops run the worlds goods
interesting disruptive official comments from milei  another dimension of psyops or 
a true leader a voice of common sense a voice for libertarism
we in the us had an opportunity to support a politician with a similarly clear view vivek speaks the same truths and points out clearly that bureaucrats are the enemy
miele is a fraud  watch remarque 88 from vancouver island canada  he speaks the truth  miele is selling out the country to the globalists behind the scene  wake up people
the whole world is like a living experiment to help us understand how to most help othersthank you argentina
the geopolitical ramifications of global monetary mismanagement are manifest 1 fed us policy is a centripetal force that sucks value into the center which benefits us holders democratic political institutions and us military superiority amplify these forces of finance see pareto laws and financial debt and leverage 2 value being sucked from the periphery to the center leads to greater wealth and income gaps both within nations and between nations 3 this leads to domestic and international unrest and conflict  politically and socially 4 the economic and political collapse of the periphery leads to regional conflicts in the struggle over shrinking resources and this means hot wars as well as political chaos 5 this results in mass migrations of refugees and their chosen destination is the center sucking up all the value which is the west and especially the usa at the same time it invites global resentmentits astounding that open border advocates cannot draw the obvious conclusions and how disastrous this will be for their political agenda chaos notwithstanding as you can see from the sequence it all starts with fiat monetary regime mismanagement at the fed in coordination with the c5 central banks its all been engineered by baby boom leaders who have assumed they are alldeserving of their elite power status the world pays for their hubris
what do you get when you cross milton friedman and general george s patton
argentina has a voice
wow  i like him even more  this speech imho is right up there with some of reagans  however javier milei is intimately familiar with socialism  we should all take heed  i am saving this to watch over and over when the mood strikes
all i see is a capitalist talking to a room of capitalists whats the big deal
yes mr pr√©sident you have described political and economical situations along history in such a clear and imparable way thank you for your speech may you bring the best and greatest succ√®s in argentina
infinite growth in a finite world
is our pathetic excuse for a government in great britain listening   i doubt it
doesnt capitalism enrich criminals in poor countries and leaves no say on the wealth doesn t capitalism tear itself apart by producing 30 times more demand isn t the only capitalist thing collapse of demand isn t corrupting profitable isn t progress doubling every 6 months without capitalism i e  world war
keep up the good work you have a long ways to go
this must be bsyop for ppl whot think this is the goal of wef socialismcapitalismcorporismno way out at this pointsoylent
in socialism only the political leaders of the countries enrich themselves at the cost of even extream poverty of the people
its strategic in days of old the king allowed the court jester to mock the royalty this prevented the plebs from rioting and maybe even killing the king same thing here
as a side note javier is not suicidal  he is not depressed he is in perfect health and his brakes on his cars are in perfect order
nice speech from a smart person there are too many crazy socialistcommunist politician in this world who make capitalistic wages while the rest are dis advantagedrichard wolff take note and wake up
holy s this dude just went and told them the truth about their self to their face which is so beautiful because this is what a lot of us 75 of the population im sure of america have been thinking were not stupid to whats going on and what the world economic forum is trying to do and we will fight even if we have to take this country back are self
the most important speech of the 21st century
administrators demonize capitalism because collectivist policies allow them to loot the wealthy
wait wait is this guy opposing wef ideology   depopulation gender woke madness etc milei you are on the wrong meeting 
he is brilliant may god protect him
is this real or ai theres no way the globalist would let this guy have the floor
this guy makes me want to move to argentina
thanks
what a star why are there so few leaders this intelligent
possibly the truest and by far the best speech ever made before the world economic forum i wish him all the luck in the world in lifting argentina away from the scourge of socialism that has plagued argentina for more than 80 years as argentina has all the natural resources fertile agricultural land the educated population and the geographical assets to become the second most powerful country in the world after america the greatest capitalist not socialist country the world has ever seen despite the insanity of joseph biden and his form of insane socialism he calls bidenism
brilliant god not gov speed
wow amazing
thankyou for posting the ideas of friedman and hayek brilliantly and simply articulated for a new generation a turning point we can hope so
yes the people who push for godless socialism are never effected by their idealogy just look at bernie saunders
everything that is wronge with our systems comes from propoganda like this  i hear him glorifying capatalism and demonizing socialism  no civilazation can survive in the long term with such an inbalanced idealogy  its his right to share his idealogy but its hardly the only one and its freedom of choice that democracy is meant to protect  my belief is that we should be careful to not summarize complex social economic concepts by naming them and using them as propoganda for movements  it only creates an excuse not to think for ones self and that makes them easily exploitable  they are only meant to be an introduction to an idea
make argentina great again
shame shame shame on davos
more deceitful internet posts
dead on love this guy
hear hear      preach the truth brother
undeniably brilliant meanwhile in north korea
wow this speech needs to be carefully studied especially young people i like best that he said if the theory is disproved the theory needs to be changed not upheld to keep trying less control and we will thrive
you can see why argentina loves him the press on the other hand will probably do what the press tend to do these days  bash him for going against the globalist agenda  you can clearly see who your enemies are
simple isnt it and thats why the globalist lizards are desperate to control all media internet and personal data
we need more world leaders like president javier milei only then would the west get back on track and abandon the ridiculousness that has befalling all of us may god protect this man and keep him safe
wow i must say that heres a sane brain speaking person  just in time as i was beginning to thinkbelieve that there were none left that see things properly this man gives some hope amidst all those hopeless folks at davos we finally hear good common sense  this man is now my world hero javier milei you must be sent from god  by god to try  breath sense to this world that is filled with senseless politicians please i am living in canada where we have a government that is totally lost  i beg you can my wife  i move to your country to live we are surrounded here in the west by lunatecs  just the thought of knowing there is a logical minded leader in argentina gives me hopei cannot help but think that you will never ever be invited back to davos because you are like oil sitting on all their water that is there  i realize that your thinking is so different that those demonic entities there in davos that they may want you dead god bless you sir i have the utmost respect for you for speaking out while you are among these insane vultures at davos god bless
she impossible to disagree with him he speaks the truth
these immigrants coming us may want to stay there  
guy is spot onspeaks the truth the big guys dont want to hear pun intended
best quote  dont be intimidated by the political class or the parasites that live off the state
huge glaring facts never addressed by this guy or anyone else all systems are doomed to failure if the people are immoral and do not fear god and follow his commandments  the usa thrived until it became godless and corrupted now nothing works right anymore
get rid of the wef we are better with out them
socialism is legalized theft government doing what an individual goes to jail for wealthy elite few making mandates is
covid was no accident  these elites get together and discuss depopulation
depending on the outcome of his life span we will know whos side he is on
not true the internet continues to function
yes
not all heroes wear capes
make argentina as great as it deserves
superb speech  very thorough i hope this is the turning point that weve been looking for x
it is obvious that he just a mouth piece of the deep state he was installed not elected the elections were staged
totally wrong economic predictions glorifies the capitalism saying its the only way brain washing for believers that its the only way how many times the economic systems broke who saved it the 1 richest got taxpayer money to get out of crisis and never return it i will wait to see argentina economy miracle good luck
they got rid of their very corrupt leader america needs to do thisand put this amazing human in chargehe has evaluated his terribly run country and put his heart to worknext is trump 2024 fighting for our freedom just likethis amazing argentenian president javier milei
i wanna hug this manmr milei america loves you if i may say so
this great man speaks for all of us argentina has a treasure and must keep his safe always  amazing speech its time our own governments stood up to this shwabb and his lynch men and brought back true values to our nationsmuch respect to geert wilder
one of the most important speeches anyone will ever hear protect this man at all costs for the life of me i never fathomed that our culture would be so divided weve completely went off the deep end those on the far left just keep doubling down on insanity the twotiered system of justice is fueling the insanity and keeping corruption ablaze
bravo capitalism and freedom are the product of an entrepreneurial society
the reason the circle goes through the 3 os is because it makes a 666
capitalism has had a century to demonstrate how selfcentered greed can magically manifest the best interests for mankind and eliminate poverty it has utterly failed to even pretend to do sopoverty isnt a bug of capitalism its a feature capitalism relies on exploitation of labor its core conceit being to drive down the cost of materials and labor that requires an exploitable labor force one that can be kept in poverty to keep labor costs lowthe alternative is a free as in beer labor force  slaves or machines and if all the work is done by machines then who is earning the paychecks to buy the goods being made what is the point of capitalism then congratulations youve just capitalismed so hard weve now become a postcapitalist society
well in a country accostumed to sort all kinds of trubles we argies are natural survivors sooner or later the mayority of the population would have the sufficient iq to overcome the brainwashing and political mafia so its almost darwinian that someone like javi rose to power a very very good and bright man
davos man is most fearful of the skewed distributional consequences of success and the danger this presents to their elite positions of power better to have the collective mitigate this distributional challenge in other words the capitalist elite prefers the mass public to subsidize economic redistribution so they may maintain their privileged positions at the top the elites under socialism fare very well in terms of relative wealth and power
benny hill is backhahhaahh
self determination for all peopke women wake up
cant believe people are so dumb not to realise that these speeches are written with full support of the wef and benefits its desired outcomes which is mass hunger and poverty and policies which will result in a world that only benefits the very wealthy and pours scorn and shame upon the working class
i have warned people about this for years
this is just plain weird why is the wef allowing this man to speak a truth that contradicts everything the wef seems to stand for i cant help but wonder what the alterior motive is
cool dude
isnt he just say that all these wef are doing a bad thing
that dude that talked over him in english in the original broadcast is crapping his pants right now
im a lil tired of that caption i get its important but my internet is not broken rant over
de centralize power get rid of greed  corruption at the core  growth for the sake of it needless consumption  waste no who no wef
thank you for standing up for the rights of human race around the globe pray for your well being and safety continue to spread the truth
finally a leader with the courage to speak the truth  no wonder he was elected president  argentina at least may have a bright future  usa needs to get it together really quick
truth
my man
great speech thank you president milei
academia can not prevail without the law of growth of civility and freedom of the people
milei supporter here from germany we will not give up the fight for freedom
you dont know what are you talking about milei is part of the wef and is also an israel deep state puppet stop making videos about things you are ignorant about milei was funded by mafias and even the same politicians he was fighting against it is all a play he has done nothing that he promised but the opposite and argentinians are already angry same as meloni in italy these all fake heroes wake uppppp stop listening to this fake news
my internet is still working perfectly fine 
 and like someone else further down the comments said the main stream media will never air this 
nikola tesla make this world not capitalism so he probably tell you you are welcome
wow this is brilliant finally someone who understands world economics and it shooting down the stakeholder capitalism envisioned by the wef
collectivism is the foundation of all achievement right from the outset this guy lost me
greedy capitalist paying peanuts to make sure you earn barely enough to get back in to work on a monday without any spare cash for living a reasonable lifestyle
the people in the audience are interested collectivism because they can personally profit from it
excellent would you please  give president trump a call  you could give him a great historical lesson in the difference between pursuit of happiness  what our usa  founding fathers first liked instead private property  god bless you  the argentinian  people
jesus christ aside from some of the prime ministers of east european countries like eg poland ive never heard a more honest speech well maybe from trump alsowow bloody hell 
this video has been edited to cut out anti socialist speech  look up the un edited video for the full truth
well said we need more leaders like him to speak out
ai has gotten nuts
an angel in satans cave
tell them to their face you will own nothing and be happy bastards
f klaus schwab trump 2024
suspicious 
he conveniently forgot to mention chattel slavery  which was the real cause of wealth in european capitalism and has failed to do anything outside of a slaveryjim crowapartheid
freedom for everything except abortion 
the world is changing  down with collectivism and the socialist barbarians
excellent speech
he destroyed schwabs ambitions at his own platform 
plese consider this my application for citizenship for argentina
take the splint out of your own eye  before you try to take the plank out of someones else jesus gave that adviceso that begs the question  who authorized these people  to covertlymake a corrupt plan for the worldchouchescu
there is no free economy if capitalists allow to have their way capitalism is destroying the us economy right now we had only partial socialism and the economy boomed and now that capitalism is destroying it right now  so what this guy is saying is total bs
you are so correct i am an entrepreneur and you are an inspiration i am a true believer in honesty
what a legend
vllc 
its like hes paying lip service for freedom to make it sound like we have allies he wouldnt be there unless he was supposed to be
this guy is spot on
good luck talking a corrupt government into having less government
i wish that president runs our poor canada
what a speech it is like a warning and a wakeup call to all western countries such as the us who is walking down this path of eventual selfdestruction socialism and the ever expansion of the government is not the solution to the problem of poverty and starvation of a country it is just the people who are already in power trying to control and disorient the normal citizens and make them believe that they are there to take care of them socialism leads to more power for the state thus leading to more separation between the rich and the poor eventually the gap will get so big that there will be division and civil unrest thus leading to the collapse of that country argentina knows this well they went through all of this within the last few decades our president in the white house better open up his ears and listen as we are sliding down the same slope that will only end up in the collapse of our society
question why is some of the speech cut and picked up in another part of the speech its pretty obvious you can see it  just sayingif your going to postva speech post the real speech instead of making it to your standards  thanks
i cant believe they invited him to let him talk  ill bet they never invite him back   for the record he flew commercial from buenos aires to this conference    i wonder if anyone else there did    i have heard that john kerry the us official spokesman for climate change flies by private jet everywhere
the translation is almost perfect except that it is missing when milei talks about abortion he says in the original speech how the bloody path of abortion
mm 
he is describing exactly what democrats are doing to the usa
the growth rate is only due to population growth there is no growth
well i was going to watch the video but apparently my internet is broke
end qualified immunity
what a wonderful testimony and history lesson that the world needs to hear  the problem is the people that need to hear wont or dont believe it because they are the problem
hi from argentinasorry about our president just when you thought we could not be more of a b to washington
wicked   need a100 n more leaders  like  him and  the  whole world   might  not   destroy  itself ps never  thought  i would  hear  a leader   speaking  so much  sense 
ah  the per capita gdp  not in itself an indicator of the wealth of regular folkthe problem with capitalism today is that it is now in reverse
this is historical and based on data not retheric  he defines collectivism and groups social justice warriors with cultural causes including things that are not natural or against nature  fantastic speech
what a man he is right with his statements
this guy has never seen a ted talk his presentation should be held to 10 minutes his droning voice works counter to his message
hes controlled oppositionhis economy doesnt even make the 05 trillion mark as if he could really smack schwab in the face another meloni bought puppet cosplaying bad boy instead of someone getting rid of neofascist wef
this man speaks the truth maybe he can come to america to teach the biden administration how to be smart and human
ai edited
sounds like reagan  and reagan doubled our national debt  everything sounds good till you implement an actual policy
why so many edits excellent speech and delivery
i respect the wef for letting him deliver this amazing speech
hard to believe they let him share this freedom in their face speech  i have no hope davos will listen i bet hell be hillaried  cant have  this truth out there
great speech thanks for sharing
viva largentinaare they taking economic migrantsthis guy just nailed it   somehow though i feel like he and argentina are going to have issues with things nowbut he told it like it really is and i would follow a man like himbefore my own unelected wef puppet tyrant  prime minister who  couldnt even talk like this let alone do anything apart from follow his masters orders
too much truth this speech must be suppressed
i heard him responding to interviews in spanish only in reality he has a great command of english language
i would buy this man a beer dam
brave man good on him probably will not get an invite back to the next meet
better and improved version of trump
that man is 100 right
given this was an ai translation with ai obviously used to sync his lips to the english version what does this mean for being able to trust anything we seehear going forward in this case i loved and agreed with the content but how will we ever know what is really being said  politicians are known for speaking out of both sides of their mouth but now there seems to be unlimited sides of their mouths in multiple languages
so if breaking up monopolies is a state intervention and will spiral and fail  how can the free market thrive  i thought monopolies were the opposite of free market capitalism
the wef will be wetting their pants after this speech
wow  that ai is good im actually blown away that it even changed his lipsmouth movements with the translation
well he chose the monopoly of violence when he chose to stick to america rather than joining bricks he is in davos wef speaker that stays it all socialism is not neocommunism lets not mix those two together i see it as much better solution than todays capitalism that turning into feudalism i think he will betray his nation if he already havent
hahahaha the argentino economy collapsed many years ago and has never recovered that s what the market corruption does for you idiocy
this is absurdly simplistic and inaccurate   he is parroting adam smith capitalism  adam smith economics is a wonderful idea but unfortunately edison started mega corporations which dominated the so called free markets from almost the beginning of the history of capitalism  monopolys and the domination of profit over well being  and more recently neo liberal economics  has destroyed the lives of the majority of the world  capitalism in its various forms unfortunately has many inherent problems  one of them being a built in seven year crisis  libertarianism as a philosophy and as an economic system has many flaws  this speech reminds me of the authoritarian and socialist simplistic arguments that become popular in times of fear  and economic deprivation  economics is a complex issue that needs new and innovative solutions that are a combination of freedom of the individual and social commons  his remark if you earn money you are creating a benefit to society is clearly inaccurate are hedge fund managers creating a benefit to society is black rock and amazon and the arms dealing corporations and the pharmaceutical companies creating a benefit to society without regulations that are socialist in their intentions the powerful dominate the vulnerable  his speech is an attempt to reignite the neoliberal capitalism which has destroyed the world in the last forty years  economics and social organisations are not as simple as capitalism versus socialism  he sounds like a child parroting cia talking points
a collective of criminals is more conveniently known as a gangcollectivists are merely gangsters
had no idea he spoke english  bravo
every system has its weakness and the weakness of capitalism is who has the most gets the most no man needs a billion dollar if you cap that people will do something else instead of getting more money which they dont need
so im just a simple john doe and huge tesla fan  investor farzad fan too who has never studied economics in depth but i have a deep appreciation and awe for nature ecosystems and humanitys dependence on them  im almost convinced that libertarianism has tremendous power to improve all our lives and reduce poverty as the speaker says but ive never heard how it takes environmental protection into account  i think libertarian theory needs to be somehow expanded to include environmental health including species diversity rich ecosystems natural abundance clean air etc etc  if every entrepreneur is allowed free reign to exploit natural resources well yes poverty may reduce per capita income may rise all may seem good  until our air becomes unbreathable our lands become agriculturally diminished our fisheries dwindle our climate becomes unlivable etc etc  this must be taken into account or well all hit a wall  the poor and the rich alike
interesting that everyone sees this as a huge revolutionary act he is just promoting a very typical libertarian economic viewpoint at an economic forum for sharing ideas i dont get whats so explosive about it
thank you for having a functioning brain with a caring heart for caring for people  compared to the hate by wef who un and woke liberals against people that created the wealth of the evil people
a great man argentina as chosen a good leader
there is s hope for the future god bless this man the world needs more leaders like him
time to party like its 1848 again baby
praise god for president milei im so happy for you argentina you will be a shining light for all of the world
bizarrely the more laws the more criminals until life itself becomes a criminal activityand you merely survive at the whim of the regime
i am a libertarian and this is the best articulation of the ideas at the core of this creed i have ever seen
absolutely right
this is an ai its not wrong though
and people call him crazy
and just like that argentina has the most courageous moral intelligent righteous objective caring and selfless leader in the world theres still good people in the world thank heaven
thank you for posting this 
pretty sure this is ai
thanks for sticking another maga finger in clauses eye make argentina great again
his lips are moving in english not spanish i suspect ai not only translated the audio but also changed the video to make his lip patterns match the translated version that means whoever directed the ai to make these changes could have changed the speech to say whatever he wanted
this ai translation is scarily good
davos 2024 hypocrisycon is on fire
only speech that matters at the davos 2024 hypocrisycon
listened 3rd time to soak in his wisdom
truth
id like to see action different than same old thing
based 
i agree on some things disagree on some things
they are not going to invite him back
wheres the millions of views unlessyoutube is at it again
vote him for president of us
this guy is a dangerous clown living in a fairytale some of what he says is true but corrupt capitalism isnt any better that corrupt socialism
acknowledging your predicament is the beginning of the solution
excellent breath of fresh air at the wef
this man telling the truth and the truth destroyed globalization and radical democrats 
when someone speaks the truth to us we absolutely know it and appreciate it  thank you milei
amen
hes amazing
well you deserve this
he is the puppet installed to make people believe the  w e f  again
knowing an evil and triumphing over it are 2 entirely different cats 
and the elite of the usa sells coal to 70 different countries hypocrites
he is the puppet to make people believe the wef again
you will own nothing and you will be happyhow can anybody not treat the organization that brought us that slogan as anything less than a mortal enemy
amazing we need more people thinking like this 
excellent speech however capitalism without a free market is a recipe for long term enslavement capitalism if unregulated by community morals and justice empowers ruthless psychopaths to become enormously powerful to the point that they control the political system and democracy becomes a charade another glaring error in his speech is the fact that energy is a main driving component of economic growth it was the discovery of so called fossil fuels that vastly leveraged labour and facilitated the economic prosperity of the last 150 years it was energy combined with capitalism now globalism combined with fascism threatens human freedom and individual prosperity
heck yeah  god bless javier  example of how the usa should proceed
good speech i hope hes morally honest and helps argentina become a great country for freedom historically argentinas politicians have been a detriment to its citizens
he went to the heart of evil and cast light on it
that was the highlight of davos ive never heard a politician speak so clearly and so passionate
meanwhile he hired ppl from the last admin to work for himppl seriously need to do their homework before blindly following these wolves in sheeps clothing
so glad to have people realize why capitalism is the best system for the rich and the broke and why every other fails
think i might sell up and move to argentina
so proud of this man a true leader
wef or should i say the few will not like what he is sayingthis is the last time he will be invited to the few or should i say wef
first class speech
central banks are the enemy
the technology used in this video is simultaneously incredible and frightening it not only translated from spanish to english but also created an overlay that makes his mouth reshape to match the words in english weve reached the point where it is impossible to distinguish reality from illusion
based argentina what an absolute chad
keep up the great work 
he gives all the credit of modern progress to capitalism as if technology isnt the driving force although its true that capitalism did fund technology it also created the biggest divide between the poor and rich that has ever existed capitalism is also funding genocide as we speak
javier milei is smarter and wiser than all the leaders of the wef put together and then some
your first mistake was fighting the english over the falkland islands that didnt go very well is it
what planet do you need to be on to think the west is heading in a socialist direction 
finally someone with balls that will tell it like it is
the problem is those at the wef have been getting megarich off these violent impoverishing cultural marxist tactics  its a business to them  they dont want to lose their  highly profitable business  and its a business that they lie about and call benevolent the one thing it is not  it is antifamily violent it is antihuman it is sexually perverse it is depressing to the mind and diminishing to the soul and offers nothing whatsoever to look forward to for anyone
javier milei president of argentina is my hero
bravo
he told those goons to go to hell in such a way they looking forward to the trip
something told he was wacky but that i didnt expect well done my wacky argentinian brother
this could be the most important speach of of our current times listen to him listen he is right
wow this man is a true leader god bless him and protect him
thank god for this man  thank you president milei for speaking truth
finally   someone speaks truth
i wish we had been taught this school
best economic and political speech in years leaving all political leaders in shackles
wow so subtitles and dubs just became obsolete
push back against globalism stand for your country i pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of america and to the republic for which it stands one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all stand and speak out for your country globalism will destroy us all
how does it help to only praise and  advertises the benefits of western  capitalists and exempt the harm of it the evil way elites practise their brand of capitalism benefits only them
omg is that scary the realism of ai screwing with his mouth accent and video capture we should be worried this could  have been used to deliver a totally different message everyone must watch out javier milei has blessed the people of his nation i hope its contagious to other countries to see this as the truth proven from our past
prayers for his safety 
a good argument for opposing the reptilians of davos and the wef these folks are not our friends
stunning speech hes fighting against very rich and powerful people i hope his message endures and is implemented
they are going to bad mouth this brave man like they do trump god bless him and keep him safe
when the markets eventually collapse it will wipe out 13 of the world  most essential commodities have tripled in price since 2020
i think just like putin and trump who said the same he aint getting another invite next year
problem is that he talks per capita gdp which is trickstatistics it grew because wealthy people are getting super wealthy while more and more regular people are getting poorer and poorer in average gdp grew but that is just a mask
amen dear sir i hope to meet you one day blessings 
very brave man to speak this truth in the belly of the beast god bless you sir
thanks for providing this farzad its important klaus schwab must be furious 
and they ask what can one person do this was an outstanding presentation from this very brave and brilliant  human being
they all are still going for their own kapatalism that till now has been their lifegoal their episode is ending and they know it
when i saw my daughter reading the upside down newspaper in her car seat on the way to preschool i realized she would do everything she saw me do some lessons are best learned first hand as we rarely question those lessons as opposed to the lessons we are taught like touching the hot stove
not so fun fact  the usa donated 60 million dollars to the wef  in 2022 to help it pay for the costs of its annual meeting in davos
fantastic speech if only 10 of those listening convert to real capitalism not crony the world will be a better place
bravo
one of the greatest most important speeches of the post world war 2 era   its time the billionaire elites and many of our leaders wake up and face the reality that we the people do not want anything that  the world economic forum offers and if they continue we will take measures against them
wow  perfect slam of the socialists communists ecoweirdos and one world goverment tyrants   love this argentine javier milei   hurrah
fjb and f kluss schwab
anyone who wants to understand this better can read any books by murray rothbard ludwig von mises or lew rockwell
best speech i have ever heard
im  behind this guy a great read i truly am very happy with his great speechfrom wef pm  from argentina
impressive
time to move to argentina i guess
a big fuck you to the world economic forum well said president javier milei
wow truth is a harder and more violent than any socialism 
i want i want i want
illegal experimentation is the american way  people need to understand our flag it originates with the east india company flag  they changed headquarters to the 13 colonies stars then shifted one stripe from white to red global colony occupied  thus the american flag but they are still pirates
long live freedom dammit
a leader i think
wow he makes so much sense on so many levels 
wow  clear concise case for growth and progress through individual freedom to be creative productive imaginative  successful  if only the wef had ears for this refreshing message  i love this man
the best lesson on reality i have ever heard 
wow this man is brave
great
forgot to mention that china is reason global poverty has been reduced tak china out and weve been declining the capitalists are in bed with the government
finally someone with some balls
sht i think ill be moving to argentina
ayn rand would be proud
you cannot help others without helping yourself libertarianism and capitalism are the most incredible ideologies and structures that have ever been built or persued
i totaly agree with javier well said
god bless argentina for electing this man argentinas articulate trump
chopped out too much sounds like a mess
my man been watching george gammon
capitalism is the best system for the world   and by the world i apparently mean only gdp  happiness index freedom and healthcare outcomes can go fuck themselves
absolutely correct
imagine jewish organisations enabling capitalism and communism equally almost like they weaponise but of course they are just clever philosophers
when one analyzes the data yeah they arent going to look at things like facts and logic and reason not their agenda
mises rothbard hayek bastiatwould be so proud
 wef
i hope those socalled socialists are listening and hearing some facts from a person that has been living it with the ccp supposedly helping and failed with a bigger disaster then these people had not much different to other countries adopting and using this socialist and communist system destroying country after country just look back at all those who the ussr claims it helped failed now they have invented climate change destroying economy after economy where the west must adopt but the communists and socialists can stall pleading poor yet like the ccp are quite all right with un classification of developing country being 2nd world economy with a military second to none developing weapons to destroy us all shooting weapons into orbit to destroy us all manipulating countries to do their bidding to destroy all working well how right is this leader who is speaking to the world as a leader who the world hasnt seen for a long time un needs to take not as do the us democrats with j biden
this seems like a tactic to regain trust and that the wef is not so bad after all pretty sure that was one of their goals this year
god bless and protect true freedom fighter milei and argentina
i like this guy he has his marbles all in order he deplores socialism as everyone in the free west should to do oherwise is showing gross stupidity or malign intention
great speech
he said women man that alone pissed them off brilliant one leader with a brain and compassion for his people hes spot on they wont ask him back because they know every dam thing he says is truth god bless him
2026 russia make istambul constantinopolis again
thanks
finally someone who is actually smart is speaking the truth
dont use ai to do translations it sucks yt subtitles are alot  better
may god  protect him may gods protect him
this guy spoke in the middle of the deepest pits of helland he got away with it
dif he make it home safely
acceptbalancecommon sense
if only the old horses of the world like america europe and the rest of south america  africa me etc would get up and hear this  excellent and true  we must stop the obvious slide toward tyranny globally which ends in war and the loss of human flourishing everywhere  milei has the morality right the moral principles
globalists have done quite well with crony capitalism but they want it all
very impressive how the ai remodels his features to speak in voice matched english translation and terrifying
finally an intelligent treatise about the best system of capitalism versus repressive socialism
defs a bigger fyou to wef than trumps speech at the wef what a legend
unfortunately no one there cares about freedom or cares what he has to say
fantastic speech
i did wonder why he was going to this event now i know why excellent speech
here i can only see the congregations comments   poor argentina
go javier go javier
as an american i learned more about economics from his speech than i learned in 12 years of liberal education in america
well they wont be inviting him back next year although they probably wont need to worry theres going to be a few interestingly fortunate accidents happening this year
i loved this man from the very first time i learned of him just a few months ago this man is the only voice of sanity in the world at this moment in time i would be very surprised if the number of falkland islanders who might rethink their future under this man increases what a place to tell them to rethink their ideas at the very heart of the place they see as home well done president milei
bravo yes what an amazing speech its the best speech the wef ever had since it existed  very logical thinking with proofs from many countries in centuries i wish president miley the very best may he could be successful
just watched the likes go to zero
freedom
this is an interesting post coming from someone that favors government financial incentive intervention in the auto market must just appear to look good whilst being a total hypocrite
nwo 99 
milton friedman is smiling in his grave
what a joke it is the most lazy repetition of basic tropes of neoliberal propagandalets watch what happen with argentina under his watch and judge by that if lizz truss was not enough
they let him speak so they can pretend that they  wefers listen to different points of view when in fact they dont
nwo  time is short
so encouraging to hear someone from another country be so well spoken and factual about the best economic and social system weve known that said its not about the money there is the spiritual aspect which must go back to if god is real its about him and his purposes  our priorities must be loving god with all of our hearts and loving others
wow what a speech thank you argentinian 
about time when someone finally calls out the wef for their evil aggenda
i cant stand it when machines do things people should be doing like speech its inhumane
thought he couldnt speak english
sir this may  be your last invitation at wef   but  what else can you really add on this    boy  you nailed it congratulations     
a worldwide leader
wait why does the a i have a spanish accent while its translating
so true
im canadian we are living under the tyrannical control of the wef puppet trudeau and his side kicks freeland and singhthe wef are a foreign political communist party aka the forth reich
and this is why they elected this man what a huge set of balls
perhaps i misunderstood but how can the monopolies inevitably created at the peak of capitalism  be considered a success of capitalism when it ruins the capitalist system  it created the persons he is arguing towards
okay why did he speak spanish with tucker and now he speaks english
wow he speaks good english
god bless argentina 
nonsense
a similar speech resulted in an all out assault on trump i hope this great man has great security
wow wow wow
argentina never was a dominant power that is an argentinean fantasy they had a great economy but never was the leading power
bless this man
if there are 110 thousand views how come there are only 11 thousand like does this mean you want socialism and or communism or are you to lazy to click your mouse
viva la libertad carajo 
congratulations to all think outside the boxes  great leaders 
truth
this from the wef  surprised they didnt cancel him
speak the truth my friend good for you good for you
javier milei  great speech  best wishes to you and argentina 
say no to globalists
brilliant he wont be asked back
andrew tate would be proud
thank youthe current afflictions  loss of freedom is their ggoal we the people must be united as they are against us we should  unite with one another they e been at wwar against us for a whiletheyre now intrnsifying their tactics  on all fronts skyairfood health land  our  be vigilant
touches and pitch forks time to go to the streets stop paying taxes and interest to the lords
maybe those damnable globalists will start to listen to wisdom and eloquence argentina should be extremely proud of having this man as their president
this guy is genius the world needs to listen to him and heed his words
i listened to the original the translation is legit he called them parasites yes
i hope he has great security  i pray that the lord god will protect him
he is 100 correct on every point 
brilliant if you agree please share this speech deserves to be heard and discussed everywhere
something looks odd about this videos movements and the speakers voice skips some is this real or a propaganda release by the wef
spot onjust truthtestedtriedprovenverified many times
a man for all seasonswith the courage to speak truth to powergod bless you sir
the problem is human nature on both sides state aswell as private companies are doing inhumane things given free reign the key is to find a balance that gives prosperity and keeps the beast in check that is what history can teach us
i hope to see more precise speeches like this the word need it
it was a privilege to hear this
socialism stinks its a con and a failure it can tolerate no opposition and eradicates any opposition often by lethal means long live free market honest capitalism
i am seriously considering moving to argentina
well i have to disagree with him the gdp explosion has nothing to do with free market capitalism but with the industrial revolution the endpoint of capitalism is always financial dictatorship there is a reason why the people that are involved with the great reset agenda are all billionaires
the fact they allowed him to say hard truths makes me suspicious of it 
capitalism might be better but its still not the answer we need to live by nature law
he didnt say the controversial agenda of abortion rights he said the bloody agenda of abortion woke translation
argentina  lets go freedom 
blindet by the light this is a idol he is placed there to gather the fools back into this system
i hope this guy has good security
listening to riveting milei the 2nd time  cant get enough of this prez
theres a vacancy in the uk later this year please apply
we need to see if argentina is willing to loan him to other countries
few statesmen are so smart and cleaver than javier milei just pay attention to his allerts and you come to the conclusion that western civilization is deeply endangered 
thank goodness that now international politics has confirmed that the majority must prevail over the agenda of the minority long live the west and our cultural values and heritage ave 
what an excellent speech and very brave given the circumstances in which it was delivered well done argentina the corrupt politicians in the uk and usa should take note
a wef puppet  preaching within the wef about free market capitalism and how it can save the world this is ridiculous sorry to spill the beans but freemarket capitalism nor wef collectivism is the answer to the issues we are facing today why because none of the two deals with two main issues 1 who prints money in the first place 2 net disposable income i know everyone is looking for a fresh leader with guts but milei is not the one
farzad thank you for posting
this dude is awesome im moving to argentina
whoh
free markets with little or no regulationsregulatory strength lead to predatory capitalism as personified by the likes of serial hoarders such as bezos and gates to make the economic pie sustainable and viable we must provide an environment that promotessupports innovation while ensuring that the hoarding swine are unable to gobble up everything of value that isnt nailed down
thats manipulationhe is talking about the freedom of the rich people
sweden has one of the highest taxes in the west at about 50 free education free child care free health care with unemployment and sickness benefits is not a failure its not a socialist country either so this speach is bs all these rules are flexible because the world is not a fixed or static thing some places are good and some are not and they have their reasons  so its not to do with the labels so much as to do with people and prosperity
the wef are fascists not socialists or communists
well said and said at the wef wow
can he be our president  we could use him hear in the usa
this was amazing  pure facts  capitalism is the biggest reason for the uplifting of people out of poverty spurring creativity and extending life in the world  the opposite communism is the reason for the most poverty death and oppression  the proof is in our history
he is saying the absolute truth glad you shared this 
god bless this man a real leader for the people
was he invited to this thing
milei flew into davos by a business class flight saving argentinians 390000  hooray  lived what you preached
thank you president javier milei1
schwarby wont like that speech
a market is a series of investments structured on perceived value for value based on the wants and needs of individuals within the market  it is an expression of human rights
stooge
he has nailed it  the irs has become an abusive spouse controlling people by fear  biden and his puppet masters have almost destroyed the american dream
in my humble opinion this man makes more sense than joe bidenmy 2 cents from belgium
mr milei perhaps you should boneup on how the us followed alan greenspans deregulation and laissez faire or free market capitalism and the consequences we now face as a result
excellent analysis thank you 
if our politicians would open their minds they too would understand all this they have a reprobate mind therfore wouldnt understand any of this
they wont like this in there idealogical club
more men like him need to stand up and circle around the facts to stop this insane socialist nonsense
looks like fake ai videonice try
it about time someone had the spine to say it thank you sir
finally somebody is speaking up against these thugs
that took guts
why are some figures being cut out
hes just a man yup a smart one
the danger to the world comes from the uber capitalist oligarchs and he is just like them this is the aristocrats telling teh peasants how to live this is just them arguing among themselves no more he is no hero to people
god be with him
the only missing element is the fraud  or misuse of fiat currency the us abandoning the gold standard said standard having its inherent flaws created the ability for governments banks to harness production towards war and confiscation 
we wish this man  the best and hope his message reaches his and all nations in the west
the non aggression is not an axiom libertarianism was coined by anarchists d√©jacque writing to proudhon in 1857 to be exact and is certainly not authoritarian as all states argentina included are time will tell if argentina works any better than the power and privilege of other state corptocracies and neomercantilist projects benjamin tucker laid out the differences in 1888 between state and non state socialism quite well
didnt anybody tell him that the usa is transforming into a communist country
yes
blessed be god for prez milei
one of the greatest speeches ever made and made from within the belly of the beast
this video has so many cuts and edits and this makes presented in a way to be taken out of context
the biggest threat to liberty is government and the demons of davos that control our governments
yes when gorbachev was taken aboard a spaceship over moscow many years ago he was told that his people were starving and he was to give up communism as it wasnt working
hero
why cant we have a president like that
they once only wanted a dumb proletariat now with people like biden and all the fools prior seems they want a dumb down leadership protect this guy because hes smart
the speech of the centurywhat a magnificent man
spot on
exposing the wefs globalist communist agenda perfect
brilliant
this man isnt just speaking facts its all common sense there isnt anything radical or controversial about what he says its all just unbiased unopinionated facts long live freedom damn it
as a canadian i approve this speech 
well he wont be getting another davos inviteklaus was probably chitting bricks
please world listen to this history lesson
this is the leader all countries need
what a way to comity suicide on tv and before the worldthey never saw him coming did theywhat a blokecitizens of free countries does that mean the falkland islands 
i think america has chinese and russian donor pulling the strings
he will soon be missing in action
bharat modi also talk like this at brics
is this an ai of the original speech that was in spanish  
you tube needs to watch trying to control free speech wef and who are thinking they are out to help the world but in fact thats not their true agenda they want to control the world for their own personal elitist progressive socialists agenda truth matters
wow  economic fact  what a breath of fresh air
capitalismcorporatism is modern day feudalism usurysocialism is jesus new commandment love each other as i loved you
he is absolutely right why is this controversial it isnt its just basic logic and history
thank you very much for this english only version the one i heard yesterday had the translator speaking overjavier this is so true no one in our country has the courage to speak out against the woke crowd who are not only killing disney and budweiser but they are also killing the entire country
i get it only now you used ai to translate it in english this is mindboggling thank you
socialismis what trudeau has grasped through the extended advisors of klaus schwab and now canada is falling into its hole
right on
so why does the ai have to use a spanish accent  is the ai racist  
thank you lord for this man and his mind
only generalissimo pinochet was successful in overthrowing the socialists  i wish president milei well   maybe ai can replace the regulators
anybody with discipline can save on capt
this man is like back in time like in the 90s now when capitalism is showing signs of its collapse this fool starts saying this haha and the media as chomsky said makes fashion being stupid they make ignorance popular etc
the wef elites will ignore every word  his speech is right on and the fact they put him up there provides cover for what the wef really wants
great speech i cant believe i was able to watch this in canada government of canada is trying hard to block this content share this video quick before canada and other countries ban it
fantastic
this guy rocks
imagine a world with total freedom in every country in the world  you  know where the actual people of each country actually governed it thats the pipe dream this guy is espousing  capitalism is based on greed allows cartels which control the money in each country and syphon off the money to whichever country offers the least taxation   this world has multiple wars around the world is this guy living in this world
precise and powerful man 
this guy just copypasting liberal propaganda and bs theres absolutelly nothing new in what he saidliberal propaganda dumbing ppl for almost 250 years cherrypicking facts supporting their idea and totally ignoring facts which treatens their structurally and fundamentally flawed dellusional idea
impressive speaker
yeah dei and wef are pushing socialism marxist communism nato is a joke all these need to be ignored or shutdown give them their own land base to grow their own country if they want this but leave america and other countries alone
as president trumps first phone call should be to argentinian president javier milei today central and south america are falling  into communist hands we know about cuba with countries like venezuela and nicaragua bending a knee to china and russia brazil has become close allies with china and the ccp ecuador will soon fall to a venezuelan invasion if the us does not intervene  china it appears is working hand in hand with the powerful cartels in mexico the entire southern hemisphere is under a communist threat argentina is vital to the us interests
portugal is destroyed by the socialist party m√°fia
listen up democrats
how can he say all that then say he is their allie  what authority do they have anyway none 
wow its almost like he doesnt get his money from blackrock elon musk billionaire macri and corporation mercado livre
dang i cant tell if this is realai is a gift and curse
he is so correct
great stuff but i cant figure why he jumped ship from brics
this man perfectly describes the socialist creep loss of freedoms and increasing poverty in canada todayif i were a young man i would be looking into immigrating to argentina
im looking into moving to argentina
why do i feel that something bad is going to happen to this man  his speech makes me want to move from the us to argentina
liberdade 
unbelievable babbling  in an attempt to save the dollar from drowning  dedollarization dedollarization dedollarization dedollarization dedollarization is the only salvation for truly free from debt slavery
would appear that javier is one man that speaks with common sense if klaus gets his way we will all be in the gulag
is a deep fake video
eloquent logical and factual most unlike the elite intellectual pygmies infesting davos at the moment
the speech was edited
this speech is one of the reasons that the wef elitists are focussing their energies to destroy free speech  less about whats said there but more directed towards posts like this speech on social media  the heritage foundation  posting is another one where the elitists want to ban discussions
god is putting it out there from every imaginable platform people wake up save our country and call on the name of the lord he is showing us truth  dont let it be trampled in the streets
dont be fooled they said we have to gain the trust back they allowing this for a reason  again dont be fooled you can fool the people sometimes but you cant fool the people all the time bob marley knew
wish our president cared that much about our country
bloody hell how was he allowed to get away with this speech  fantastic
i love how he quotes the us constitution as universal values 
ai voice and lips movement
lots of statistis but not much more
so keep capitalism and the high prices and low pay this is the best answer he could come up with
rolling babbling speech that no one will even retain in any normal setting reading like a robot dedollarizededollarize dedollarize and dedollarize  
you put a genuine first herestating that the video is manipulated but only to the purpose of negotiating his words to us we can believe it or notoh i think its legit but youve started something my friend not sure how to swallow itand that beside the speech itself oh boy what a messcheers
there is no climate change and we are the carbon the wef want eliminated
036 he was going to say communism
this ai is nuts even making the mouth look like its speaking in english
nothing but theatrical performance oh but a poor one get yourselves informed folks its free argentina is nothing but a private owned global corporation
amen  the state and the parasites running it are the problem not the solution  long live freedom and prosperity everywhere but especially in the us
bravo but stay away from the kerb
wow bravo 
hes the trump of south america
john galt is alive and well god bless and keep him safe
how did you get his lips move in english 
deepfake
freedoms  attached to capitalism is debtor slavery and you just make the top  of the rich able to wage wars around the world while they use the poor as canon fodder
austin powers brother
im praying for his safety god bless him
bogus logic it is technological breakthroughs that has created a globally connected world this physical and digital global infrastructure that has created argentina got sideline with panama canal and suez canal american capitalists controlled argentinas wealth china is the socialistcapitalist competitor china has fabulous upliftment of its population with a mixed socialistic capitalism model we must put an upper and lower bar on wealth put a limit on how low we allow human kids to live in terms of meeting their physical and mental needs put an upper limit on how much wealth a single person can control world will be better off
how much did this get edited you can see lots of cuts
why is so many billionaires with possession of all earth sources when millions of people dies every year  from hunger poverty and wars created by globalist all  their economy does not work for centurys and  gross domestic  income distribution is wrong in every country they grabbing robbing and control every possible sources of income when everything on the  earth belong to all of us  with respect of the nature and god created balance  in it our mother earth will dies in five years if we do not stop and remove this poison and madness people wake up stand up  against this tyrants  or we all die soon
nice work
socialism creates equality across the board  
the only thing more eye opening than this speech is the fact ai was used to both translate and reanimate his mouth and using his voice to give the appearance that he spoke in english we are transitioning into very dangerous times where we may not be able to trust anything distributed by the media
you mean that the anti dog eat dog model cannot work  who knew
wow  what a great speech i dont totally love the system he is advocating but i do think it is the best one we have available
let us not forget karl marx own quote for a socialist  system to be possibleit must be financed by capital accumulated by a capitalist system
they should have let him hold the mic so he could drop it at the end of the speech
are these stats real  he says by 2020 only 5 of the world population was living in poverty  the number seems too small
debtor slaves keep capitalism afloat  
who rules the world in a capitalist system where did he give the speech why would capitalists want to end capitalisim
thank you argentina 
capitalism creates poverty and is separated by class 
oh yeah socialism is running rampant across the world workers are definitely controlling and directing the worlds social and political direction it is not at all true that the world is controlled by capitalism this speech is straight up orwellian newspeak he seemingly thinks that just because he can say a thing it makes it true reminds me of another former leader of a failing capitalist country i foresee the same fate for this guy endless lawsuits and criminal indictments
damngave me the chills
why is this video so edited
right on 
people share this video 
i love this guy 
omg god bless this man
this  guy is the hero of the world 
this is wonderful but youve edited his speech in bits and pieces and its annoying  the speech is 25 minutes not 19 minutes
canada is well on its way to socialism under trudeau and freeland
i dont know if this speech is real or not but if it isnt it should be it is truth
thanks for telling those theives they have robbed africans and they use their media to write trash on african we have suffered from disease for 400yrs i thank the media for exposing these selfish people killing poor people
what a joke a wolf in sheeps clothing anything but trust building
we wish we had a president like this one many people in different countries wishing for a president like argentina has now he is honest brilliant and absolutely correct about failure of socialism its only breeding parasites bureaucrats  suffocating businesses and poverty as a result argentina is very lucky
the wef should make reading atlas shrugged an essential element for membership perhaps a lecture on the book would rebuild trust
bravo
in other words markets fail when a bully is involved
it seems to me that capitalism only makes specific people wealthy it is not a proven system for all the people to gain financial independence you still have people who make the least money working the hardest throughout the world this has got to change capitalism is not the solution
common sense
love this man im in canada  seeing exactly what he is saying  peace 
we must protect this man at all costs
i never thought that one speech that actually refers to valid data and historic points could dismantle the deep rooted socialist tendancies in my thinking i wish he also told his opinion on the usual maxist defence line but marx suggested socialism only after a nation is fully industrialized i would like to hear his opinions on that
after watching him hug zelensky i will take a pass
only big gripes abortion right isnt about population control lol but about body right and freedom
the only thing worse than free market capitalism is collectivism and the dead hand of the central planner self appointed elites take note
growth capitalism but with antitrust laws governments unable to be lobbied bought off  do their job to assure free markets  until people have integrity  moral fortitute across the board  nothing will change much
this guy has more grit and integrity than all the idiot leaders that sold their souls to the devil
well said i agree  wef who  un are based on communism  leave the people alone and govern yourself
i  cant believe what im listening to wow tremendous speaker argentina hang onto this man he is a gem
any smart businessperson and developer nowadays knows that what milei said is true the idea of having to pay for employees or government politicians who produce nothing is something that nobody likes entrepreneurs work hard to create businesses that are truly valuable to society but end up having to pay taxes to support these kinds of people the parasites everyone sees this as extremely unfairentrepreneurs are natural builders of society it is these people who drive the evolution of things
awesome speech awesome
the essence of beneficial capitalism is take your hand from my pocket and make it work to profit yourself
the socialists will say yes but you didnt try real socialism i am surprised the wef let this man talk315 only problem with his growth stats since the year 2000 is the fact the value of currencies fell because of a huge increase in the money supply
ameliorated capitalism not the kind that eats its own foot coercion the governments only real tool socialism monkeys fighting over an elephant turd after all the good food is gone
fantastic south africa has gone down the socialist path as well under the corrupt anc and we are suffering thanks to it this year we hope for change in our national elections
in todays world to hear this is a breath of fresh air im praying that people will listen and join together to change the direction of the west and the world
im surprised they didnt take him out mid speech
let him experiment in his own country
finally the communists in the eu  and the united states  are being called out their faces
we have found our another modern day john galt javier milei 
im not sure when he is against the wef why have the invated him we will see how he is acting at home
we should all take up the baton in this relay race for freedom bravo argentina for casting off your shackles may the wind beneath your wings treat you kindly
it wont make a difference so they allow him to talk and get to prove they still have the power by doing nothing who is going to change anything him lol thats a joke they still have the power
epic javier is the real deal
this video is also edited using ai you can see his lips reading english but original was in spanish i dont trust it anymore it could be all made up
he is spot on we are seeing it live with the united states what he just said how do we stop it if election weee rigged and the state is to powerful
aristotle promoted democracy and capitalism  for the citizens prosperity while plato promoted collectivism and communism for social justice
im british we started the industrial revolution and ended up with an empire that empire aged and now looks after itself that is apart from africa which is determined to go back to the stone age and winning unfortunately things are changing  i never thought i would see our nhs police and security destroyed even the bbc is not worth watching they quietly ignore any nasty news meanwhile the police walk around in handcuffs whats left of them
thanks for the reminder of my comments youtube 
hes about as argentine as the good humor man
thank you man for the truth some people get a hard time to eat this truth
the reason they are raising up leaders for us is because artificial intelligence is the new power  this is all a distraction  humans are always 1 step behind
according to milei socialism has already been given a fair chance for a 100 years and it sucks
 trumpsters assemble wow  he sounds like a trumpster 
doesnt it give the impression that the peoples of the world are being listened tothat there is something being doneguess whatits all illusion they want their agenda 2030and they put muppets like this on to create that illusion pessimistic yesbut also true
as an expert of economics  his speech is so true and precise praise the lord hallelujah
wow that translation simulating his voice is amazing
sounds like one of the few absolute truths today  it is unfortunate that todays leaders value personal and party greed and an emotional feel good mentality over the welfare of the society they lead  we need to clone this guy
for those who think its fake because its in english this is only translates and dubbed he did speak in native language
bravo pres milei of argentina you must have just woken up the wannabe tyrants in this cult called wef
did he give the speech both in english and espa√±ol
nothing wrong with my internet  not broken pity not all his words are audible but he speaks the truth
daaaaammmm he did not hold back kudos to him if only canada had such a leader wed be progressing by leaps and bounds given our natural resources
a misleading procapitalismlike speech promoting free competition and rejecting government overreach but at the same time it advocates private monopolies and goes against public control over their unhinged arbitrary powers
i like socialism in the sense that if the system can create billionaires and soon trillionaires it makes sense that every human on earth should have housing internet access food clothing healthcare and education as rights this speech made me reconsider that maybe what we really need instead of socialism is a free market capitalism that provides these basic rights as a foundation but still incentivises growth and development which will reward those that are self motivated to improve their skills and standing i think this would be a much more inclusive model that would allow the entire world to have the nessicary tools to contribute to the world economy if desired right now there are only a few players making the decisions and dictating policy whenever a small minority is making decisions for the majority it is very seldom if at all that these decisions will benefit the masses
right on brotherwe aint sleeping in america we know whats upbelieve thatthem traders aint fooling noonetheir so dumb
wanna know what we get from free market capitalism extreme wealth despairty people who will never be able to pay off student debt for life no healthcare  poor people getting poorer and poorer while the rich get richer and richer to the point where money doesnt even exist for them
americans here is a country we can move to too run from bidenobama communism
excellent speech
this man has got his head screwed on straight
so he is not an idiot
if you compare the amount of taxes and economic wealth between different countries the countries with higher taxes usually have higher economic wealth places like texas is an odd out with low taxes and high wealth they are also suffering with bad infrastructures
congrats sir you deliver speech that should change the current old principles
has this president not been aware of the impact technology has had on the dodgy metric of gdp or migration of new citizens on the growth of an economy i mean this is just not true
and the panto continues hes all in on it
downward spiral of regulation leaving us all poorersounds like california
whatever the american democrat politician is in favor of do the opposite got it
well done pres milei argentina is lucky to have you as president god bless  protect you
can we just clone him i want one
brilliant  fricken brilliant  
is this fake  its too funny to be true
hes correct about economic growth and free markets  however there were innumerable environmental disasters before the epa and government reigning in industry with environmental safeguards  i live in a town where the main river was polluted by ge decades ago and to this day you cant swim in it or harvest fish from it  in ohio a river famously caught on fire due to so many pollutants  lead in paint used to poison thousands of kids  the state must impose some regulations  however it can go too far  elon musk recently made the point that people die but regulations dont and tend to accumulate over time strangling freedom and growth  so we must be careful in both directions
this perspective totally ignores how monopolies can crush personal freedoms and that the happiest and healthiest people on the planet scientifically proven live in more socialist orientated cultures 
great speech from the philippines
just ending corruption and allowing democracy is what did it capitalism aka middleman had nothing to do with it capitalism does not allow free markets it is democracy pulls people out of poverty that is what the evidence shows
this is the coolest thing ever i love this long live
so true
he is 200 years late though  and lets see how his country will evolve with open market economy might not be as easy for him as he thinks good luck though 
how long before argentina gets on usuk black list
free market capitalism is good but it wont solve the worlds problems  there will always be greedy pukes who rise to positions of power and they use that power to abuse others  the solution is to overcome human nature  only jesus can help us do that
this is goldclearly something has shifted youtube allowed it
well said that man 
im waiting for the meme of this speech that shows a target on javier starting as a dot and getting bigger and bigger the more he talks what a great guy god protect him
makes me want to move to argentina
beautiful
excellent excellent speech i bet hell never get invited back for pointing out the truth and the culprits
if the ai just trasnlated it id be fine with that but because it is changing his lips to make it look like he speaking english  weirdly i dont trust it and think its a fake anyone else feel this way
if wef is rejected entirely then all it stands for and promotes is also rejectedwef must be terminated now
i would love to know how he got to davos wef with the wolves
he leads argentina i wish he led the world
thank you from all free people for speaking the truth  stay safe stay free stay strong  
his english is impeccable
  long live argentina bravo

the world is changing  
argentina keep this up holding the torch for freedom the falklands will vote to be part of argentina love from uk
even if this is genuinetalk is cheap
what a bad ass god bless this man and argentina
yeeeeah i like his stance on climate change and guns but daaaamn he needs to start watching more louis rossmann what big companies are doing on supply side in the name of profits make no mistake there will always be a need for the state to curb the power of ultra wealthy and nobody will ever pay their taxes of their own will but we still need the services that the state is providing be it courts so that not every dispute needs to be settled by personal duel military so that other states cant endanger us or healthcare so that we dont end up like in usa where massive debts stemming from healthcare services provided non uncommonly at brink of death are the greatest cause of personal bankruptcies if society is to survive some level of coercion is necessary and inevitable because heshe who gains enough power will become hegemon in the system and start to create and enforce rules as it fits them because they dont feel the need to not infringe on others humans have simply not evolved to obide by the rules needed for this kind of approach to be sustainable for more than a generation has argentina gone waaay too far left in the past yes is going this much right the appropriate answer no
us puppet argentinas grave mentally fragile
it reminded me the time machine movie when the main character george wells rod taylor persuaded humans not to step into the morlocks cave you figure out who the morlocks are in 2024
go javier milei 
thank you
awe they didnt include his last four words well the last word really
truth   freedom   peace    
love javier sadly it falls on def ears there is an agenda and we the people need to stop it its evil socialism
he is a rambling i d i o t 
greed is good
problem is globalist want poverty and control  it provides them an easy way to steal from the people without answering to anyone benifits will always go to the rich   but we all know what happens to the rich man in the judgments   satan is driving the globalist and they dont even know it 
the free market is infinitely dynamically and self adjusted by its  participants central control economy is not thus a failure modern capitalism problems rise of oligarch monopolies greed for which laws are established to control but weak politicians fail to ensure they are applied even in ancient greece oligarchsmonopolists were a problem one that the citizens actively kept in checkgreed power monopolies are a weakness in human nature davos is an altar for which the modern monopolists come to worship stroke their ego and collectively scheme politicians for more even profit and power  they talk about virtuous causes while hoarding 80 of the worlds wealth is inequitable is that
this guy is not talking about you or i he is talking about the mega rich
nobody is on our side its all a show and we are just watching
globalist puppet
man of the year award for this brilliant man
bien echo se√±or presidente 
vllc  llfd
ban genderfraud economic warfares2
he has to rattle this of by reading because its a hodge podge talking about capitalism while ignoring the financial capitalism which is making the wealthy wealthier and destroying all the proletariat has gained through their collective action in history against the elites the davos elites have promoted the woke mind virus to divide and conquer populations so they can become richer their money has bought out the politicians and controls the deep state see micheal hudson to learn about financial capitalism argentina is going to be a disaster under this guy
lord jesus praying for this man safety please continue to bless him with your wisdom aman  thank you sir for standing up for truth and righteousness may the lord jesus blessing and protection be with you aman 
mic drop about time someone says it like it is
this guy is awesomemaga
coercion because of waror abandoning fossil fuels before developing sufficient green energy brings misery to the world
the movement of his lips looks like a fake
nothing short of brilliant
capitalism is the moral ideal social structure free markets work
why does this look like ai generated the mouth looks off the cadence is also off
dont you love listening to rich people tell you how well off you are in living in poverty
ban outlaw all socializm  communizm
stop funding for tyranny 
spot on
can somebody forward this to you know who  i mean like right now thats no excuse wake em  up      tell him you got a bunch of  that might doit
the wef let him speak because they knew what he was going to say klaus schwab introduced him the people were dissatisfied so they gave them someone to eas the tensionsthey also know that they cant be stopped this is to give us the feeling as if things are changing this guy is going to hand the government over to the same  corporations listen carefully what he says
finally a president with brains go argentina  i hope nothing happens to him
no to wef  they are not our leaders
but mr milei we need the people to be poor
great speech but he forgot to say wef  afuera
liberty lets go
bravo bravo
we need trump
economic slaverythe masonic order governmentis a corporate business entity and the presbyterian church the american slave code act of 1853 is being used in conjunction with the articles of association of 1774associated loyalist articles of association is the articles of incorporationa pledge of allegiance to the king they have allowed the umbrella of shared power with  they created the us constitution to be used for debtto borrow money  from the silk road then they used pirate  codes to and for sharing the booty articles of agreement the banks have been using the chattel as propertybonded by your social security code to the slave systemwe know the truth now our taxes has caused the collapse of your monarchy democracy we in the united states are a republica confederate republic
peace libertys 4all
this person should be every countrys president
this ai shit is getting pretty goodl for those wondering the speech is legit and translation is legit originally the speach was given in spanish but this is ai generated with english ps mouth sync is phenomenal
bravo excellent
speaking in front of the organization that wants to reduce world population aggressively
i feel with leaders like this in the world there is still hope i fear however his words will fall on deaf ears of those intent on controlling and owning everything on the planet down to the last grain of sand
there goes his invite next year
agreed  but the state does need to break up monopolies when some of these capitalists get too greedy
this is what true world economic forum should be
brilliant i love this man
i this ai
this is so true thank you for telling the truth
i love what this guy says
world economic forumafuera
the wealthy people at davos gained their wealth through capitalism  now that they have bought all they can  they will show the world that we need to embrace socialism and give up our property  its the final step for oligarchs
this is like preaching to the devil
according to biden this is hate speech that needs to be a eradicated with the use of the government armorment
the state is the problem not the solution
amazing
if this is your first interaction with wef then i suggest that you take a look at the rest  as this is in many ways the polar opposite of what is really happening there
corporations are governments governments are corporations libertarianism is brain cancercompletely unrestricted lesse faire capitalism or any inadequately regulated capitalism leads to monopoly whether a simple monopoly or an effective monopoly through a cabal of centrally controlled fake competitors which leads to the exact same central planning as happens in a socialist country the structures are all the same and only the names changethe system which we had when all of this prosperity happened had nothing whatsoever to do with the ayn rand lesse faire capitalism devoid of regulation claimed here it was always very tightly regulated government funding and nazi engineering landed us on the moon not libertarian social or economic ideology
imagine if this message was distributed globally unfortunately due to filters its probably only being heard by those of us who already agree and dont need to hear it
it might not be news to many but the accuracy ai has to translate mileis voice to english down to a t is scary
vamos leonnn  y recien prendiendo motores
he is an economist so clearly hes had real time views  the mayor of medellin replaced an economics professor who turned the region around
amen praise jhezus 4truths honorz justicez
according to biden this is dangerous hate speech that should be a eradicated with the use of the government armament
bravo  i completely agree with this message
he is a puppet of the cia and the military industrial complex
amen
president milei is now the leader and leading voice for capitalism and the western values the us has forfeited their position  unfortunately
this is amazing and thank you from the bottom of my heart to know that critical thinkers instead of fear mongers is allowed to lead our thoughts and ideasbrain washing is all we get anymoreif your mind hasnt been taken you will know thistoday is a good day
this is wild so this speech was in spanish and ai not only translated the speech but also adjusted his mouth movements so it looks like he is speaking english how can we ever trust our eyes
bravo thank you mr milei your excellent presentation is full of wisdom and common sense the historical support of the free market and capitalism is very compelling we need freedom loving leaders with your ideas to speak up on behalf of the people of this world your insight  wisdom and presidential witness is astounding argentina will regain her previous greatness under your leadership yes some  pain and sacrifice will be a part of this growth  axios 
great speech god bless you milei
thanku thanku thanku
     let him be the president of the new world order
god bless this man a true leader he is for the people not for the government freedom
he is a real economist  thank you 
i seen the original with subtitles first but i can barely tell that ai changed his lip movement that scares me even though i agree whole heartedly with the message such mixed feelings about the vide
he reminded me so much of the great ronald reagan
the usa is with argentina
javier miele is hero to all freedom loving people
they regreat to invite  him lol but careful  maybe a move to target him out the way same they did with trunp
nice try but this technology isnt quite ready for prime time is iti prefer this historic address in the original spanishi hope milei can accomplish at least half of his goals before the people in that room have him killed
for the president of argentina americans are whit you 
love it bravo argentina
beautifully spoken words sir thank you for saying what so many are scared to your words will get inspire many to see whats happening
his lips are matching the words he is speaking but you can see there is editing
interesting  this adds to my hunch that this has not gone viral you would need a fairly good education to absorb and agree or disagree with this speech viral no way  1400  he seems to speak of the us constitutions main foundation as a feminine agenda and yet he believes in the economic foundation of free markets  life liberty and equality for all and ownership of private property his conclusion in my view becomes skewed  here    lets see if all the entrepreneurs can pull argentina back from the brink like he seems to suggest and even the free markets do need monitoring to cause an even playing field and to undo insider trading
gay bentos
bravo
awake vs woke  its onn
best 20 minute speech i have heard in a very long time
rebuilding trust kinda scared to find out what they mean by this
democrats and republicans are two sides of the same coin  robert f kennedy is the only candidate worth voting for take back our country
failed to mention the volumes of national debt associated with capitalism  argentina 400bn  usa 34tn  the majority population being poor hasnt changed consumerism keeps us poor while the wealth gap with the elite gets bigger  half of the uk is owned by 1 of the population similar for rhe us we have billionaires while over 6million people die each year from lack of clean watercapitalism sucks  it sustains greed and artificially inflates costs for normal folkin the uk energy company profits have increased by 1000 but apparently they are only passing on increased wholesale costs because of the ukraine warwhat utter sh1te  the uk does not get any gas or oil from ukraine we get it ftom norway or our own north sea wells and renewable sources  our capitalist government are too corrupt to stop the energy companies profiteeringat least in norway they charge heavy taxes to these companies to create a sovereign wealth fund to pay for citizens healthcare and pensionsbut go ahead and continue to blindly support this idea that capitalism generates growthits unsustainable no amount of quantitive easing will solve it and ordinary folk will bear the cost when it collapses
if this broke the internet how come im able to watch it   
looks faaaaake af though  at least with subtitles you could verify if the translation is true  once this tech is good enough you wont even know if what youre watching is purely ai generated anymore  were doomed
viva la liberdad cara
more power to him  we need more so called leaders to speak the truth but we also need to shake out of the apathy that will end with us all in chains
the west has moved toward socialism and liberalism and that is not a good thing
the problem here though the people he is giving the speech too  agree with him they want it their way  those are deaf ears
great speech  i have to get a copyhe knows what the communists have done he knows what went on during the french revolution and who financed it and who lied about the royalty and who truly destroyed their economy he knows very well that karl marx was a sociopath and the evil that spread from itin america we have historically ignorant sociopathic radical leftists running the show in america we have privileged lazy but shrewd communists teaching in all the grades of schoolingcollectivism is being pushed in ireland netherlands germany and all over and the farmers know they are getting screwed the rulers are sociopaths
instand with argentina
afuera
the us got this guy his name is trump or vivek
long live freedom damnit hahaha what an ending
finally the world is waking up god bless this man and hope it spreads around the world
thanks farzad for posting this good work
he made them all look dumb af
im gobsmacked simplistic broad strokes cut down the amazon forests and sell it all off  deice antarctica for the oil and minerals who cares argentina going down the drain again
900   enforced socialism has caused 100 million lives the past century   oksounds great  for a reset in thinking about changing anything because you think something is a great opportunity
it is time it is now
argentina wont be permitted to attend next years bash
bravo brilliant truth
i want to hear biden speak japanese
when this guy was recently elected the us media tried to portray him as some crazy nut
sounded much like i would expect to hear from a university professor 60yrs agoif melei does not have a phd in economics he should be presented one immediately
i hope that im wrong but with this kind of leader is like seeing a crash in slow motion
stagedthey know that this guy is all about if they were really afraid he could wreck their plan hed be cancelledall political theatre  blood need to be spilled then people will listen
     bravo fg fantastic
long live freedom
the state is not the solution the state is the problem itself
ai is becoming increasingly helpful and as a result human translators are becoming obsolete
yessssssssssss eat it esg
this con man is already crashing and burning but he sure loves to talk yet say nothing of importance
me gusta m√°s en espa√±ol viva la libertad carajo
what exactly was new about this bullsh1t speech its the same crap i always here and it never works
the wef doesnt car what is said they want control of everything and they wont stop until they get it god bless you mr milei
wow that was fascinating i feel he has a lot right a good summing up of the west and its madnesses
i will start a business in argentina if everything goes right
killed 100million people  dont tell klaus schwab and bill gates that they love to hear that outcome
the wef klaus schwab wants to take freedom and kerry blinken and others  to take control then to force disarming the peoplethen forced subjugation 
i dont understand he could not speak english when tucker interviewed him now he delivers a whole speech in english something is wrong with this guy i hope iam wrong but maybe he is working for the wef you never know they have been playing the people for many years
i wouldnt use ai or any form of editing for anything political whether its intentions were for a good purpose or not it will be construedand very well should be as manipulation of facts just keep the original speech and translate it with subtitles
capitalism if the rich people end up spending all that money creating an esg to force change then the customers are allowed to push them into woodchippers as a way to create equilibrium and balance in the world again we can grow new elites but they can only reduce the population 99 one time folks
its not hard for the annointed to completely ignore the facts and push their vision on the unassuming
socialism where bankers tech giants and international conglomerates without loyalty to any national government run everything sure thats socialism alright 
in general terms this is spot on the state should have the least necessary rules and regulations to allow all to thrive and prosper this is correct but its important to distinguish between libertarian ideas and anythinggoes anarchism in which there is no compulsion to produce and be a social benefactorhis point about bureaucrats as parasites is absolutely on point
the answer as always is in the middle unfettered capitalism succeed at any cost leads to anarchy unfettered socialism evenly distribute at any cost leads to communismtotalitarianism the combination of systems leads to a third position the correct position
wonderful beautiful truth
i say he ditch argentina come over to the us   just go across at the mexico us border i will pick you up once you cross the river you are going to be our new president   
brilliant speech i hope those brainwashed audience members took it on board well done to this man hes a hero
what a great speech  way to stand up to the woke generation
hard to trust the content and context when this has been so obviously heavily edited
he speaks of a growth of wealth but comfortably leaves out at whose expense this wealth was bought he speaks of wealth in terms of materialism not human wellbeing he speaks of growth as if getting more was a desirable outcome instead of being happy with what you got all they ever do is cherrypicking  speaking about the supposed upsides of capitalism but what about the millions of people who die under the consequences of capitalism what about the environmental catastrophies ultimately caused by companies trying to maximize profit what about the people who cant afford medicine because the market dictates an insanely high price is that the way of freedom i assume this speech was written by some ceo eco manager guy who only cares for numbers and charts that go up
klaus screwed up letting javier speak truth to the crowed
well said
i like my boosters forced and not so safe or effective  no joke so dont arrest me for making meme
hes telling this to the leaders who caused this issue most of them are probably too arrogant to listen to this man since they truly think they can understand the economy as was stated in the speech
drival and drool
protect this man at all costs
wow 
as a brit  im really starting to like argentina
never judge a man by the chainsaw he swings during an election campaignthis man is a genius amazing history of world economics delivered in a very concise mannerbrilliant speech and hats off to the interpreter
they know they can let him say whatever he wants maybe except the epstein list because this here is the only place for anyone to hear him they control the 99 of the media and there will be no coverage there
otherwise ca  the wef force byd electric  vehicles  on us all and nobody wants  that 
i agree  with  the problem  is surface  through  out  the  world
bravo sir why the west survived supreme for a long time we can compare the past and current systems
well i have look close and cant see the strings he talking really fast maybe he used too much of south american product
javier threw down the gauntlet  bill gates  klaus are going to be very angry that javier gave away the plot
no wasted words and an incredible insight a brilliant analysis
does misinformation mean i cant point out that global death rates are up 30 and it appears to be linked to the wef forced booster programs
essentially he saying capitalism is great and its not everyone becomes a whore for money maybe the average lifespan of people in the east and africa would have longer avg lifespans if they could go one year without the west sending proxies to overthrow countries
protect this man at all costs he is at great risk speaking out against the evils of the wef and the elite class across the western world communism is evil it always has been it always will be they cannot be allowed to force it on us especially this brutally deformed flavour of communism where they use fascism to implement it
no one voted for these nazis  the wef is a dangerous entity that needs to be shut down
god bless you javier i love you i love you i love you you are the best you rip the biggest hole on the psychopaths thank you thank you thank you i wish you was our president here in the united states i applaud you
the biggest problem with capitalism is the corruption within the system and the deck being stacked unfairly due to it  the more and more its obvious that people in power can make deals that work specifically in their favor the more the lack of trust in the system  the more big businesses can lobby the government to tip the scales in their favor the more distrust people have in the system  how many more crooked and paid off politicians and how many more 2008 type events must people endure  that is the problem
god bless milei
can this guy run for president in the us please
im a patriot
welcome to the lies of the one world order
maybe states should promote things that are good for the economy like education for as many as possible and good health for as many as possible
a great man with great insight
what freedom this incoherent man is talking about west is violence  lies the biggest  poverty redaction  happen in china in last 30 years  the more  neomarksism  fashism  is the west
so the people in free countries live longer  ok  what is the current life expectancy of the us and india compare to china  the life expectancy of chinese is 7821 years and the us is 7628  india is about 70
how i pray this speech reaches the ears and souls of this current administration here in the once great nation the united states of america
thank god for this leader
you are not saying the misery creating by the argentina unta advocating pure capitalism
damn ai translator is madly fast i though he was fluent in english but nah he isnt wrong and the wef will prey on argentina that exposed they evil plans
amazing statements and evaluation 
did those at davos listening to his speech not understand what he was saying the mind boggles
benny hill
brilliant true based on facts and history the world would truly be heaven on earth if more world leaders would be like javier milei yes ppl have to work nothing is for free 
god bless you milei
its fake his words are cut up and rearranged hes a globalist shill
never overuse an explanation model even if it is very tempting no model explains everything models arent reality
please god watch over and protect this man he has important work to do in jesus name amen
bravo   
love this guy
no matter what system you choose if the operators are corrupt and that corruption is purposely spread throughout all your institutions a constipation of the whole system will ensue that will bring everything crashing down the type of people involved in this are of course morally bankrupt and together form a club that enjoys what once was considered the unspeakable deviation of every conceivable sort and many that are beyond the normal imagination if you think that is a wild over statement be a fly on the wall of those in high office in any western government or royalty particularly washington or wefminster then delve into what happens in the tunnels and dark places below these buildings and i include places of worship you will need a strong constitution it really doesnt matter how good the set up is if those in charge are evil the direction of travel will continue downward adding to the decline over the years has been the secret societies like freemasonry which is full of demonic references which demand greater adherence the higher the rank those beyond 33deg level only being for the top echelons of society it can be no coincidence that as our spiritual lives have fallen into neglect so our care for each other and our responsibility for each other has tanked industrialists during the british industrial revolution were often staunch non conformist christians god fearing who expected to have to answer to a deity for their dealings with those over whom they had huge power they were the ones who paid a fair wage gave bonuses and provided safe clean places of work even occasionally schooling for the children with nature trips out of the grime occasionally the new testament in those days was a force to be reckoned with and plenty of hell fire preachers giving sermons to packed churches it was control of course but a lot of it if done in the right spirit created good social practices that are not adhered to today so in my opinion it is the collapse of moral standards no matter where they stem from that has created the situation we face and only a speedy return to those origins that promote them will save us and they certainly wont be found at davos
i saw this speech and he spoke spanish is this accurate is this ai making him look like hes speaking english ive seen many interviews and he never speaks english im so confused
just here to comment that i managed to watch this without my internet breaking my broadband provider is bt im sure youre all wondering since your internet broke
sith lord soros needs to go away
it is sad to see the destruction of economies by the power hungry leaders of great countries the new cult of climate and other insane beliefs are killing freedoms and liberty
awesome   im happy for argentina
did he say freedom to abortions is lack of freedom or did i misunderstand
great speech pity it will fall on deaf ears
he is a dose of freedom liberty and common sense our world needs thank you president milei
great speech  i loved it  hats of to the man   these are the answers 
another delusional person in power 
milei is supposed to be an economist  argentina is by all measures highly politically corrupt when you have rampant corruption no system works besides the highest taxed countries are denmark sweden finland belgium etc countries that fund social goods like education and health care the guys a monkey that was elected because the other 2 choices were overtly corrupt milei maybe just maybe isnt as corrupt but putting his sister in a position of power isnt a great start argentina is overly generous with its free public education offering it to even foreigners the standard of education in argentina is nevertheless very good governed well it should be similar to the australian economy with its 3 major exports  resources tourism and education
then no need to worry about overpopulation the capitalism must be corrected to maximum utilization rational distribution of wealth and ceiling of individual wealth
god bless this man 
twisted mind
the children of the wef revolution are eating up the wef revolution 
tobacco companies  market failure or what just asking have no understanding
at lasta world leader leading rather than collecting other leaders and sabotaging other democratic institutions
this is very good  wow
thank god this man tells the truth wefhow are completely out of touch with the real truth science there is no global warming only the banksters can use it to make billions as another sauce of currency that they trade for 700 profit from their rigged stock markets the banksters elite bankers system is nothing more than a collapsing ponzi schemes for the owners 6 profit of every dollar borrowed into existence this system must be scrapped now the briks have trade of 44 of global wealth and growing every year as another 30 countries will joint them in 2024 i want the wef to stop being leaders of a current clown world of today the elite own the media will rubbish outcomes the world clowns must stop today prosperity is the way forward with free market capitalism free the world from this organisation
thank god there is one world leader in davos who is not purely evil and corrupt the truth will set you free god bless and protect javier milei
markey failure is imaginary  only regulation can strangle the market
all must listen  and listen close
what is up with that did he get the invitation to speak as an accident is this a diversion
these unelected people have way to much power over the citizens of the world
i like to say i hope my government is listening but i doubt it
damn i like milei more every time i hear him speak i hope his election and presidency starts a chain reaction around the world it kind of feels like thats starting to happen  but its pissing off the marxists its like hang it up man  marxism doesnt work and cant be reconfigured to be anywhere near as effective free and productive as capitalism  you tend to end up with psychotic dictators like stalin mao kim pol pot etc not to mention the fact that marxism at its core  regardless of its stated purpose  stifles freedom and takes power and resources from the people and centralizes them into the hands of a few party members for supposed redistribution and those people invariably abuse their position to enrich themselves at the expense of the greater population capitalism isnt perfect either but unlike marxism it has been proven to work and enhance peoples lives and enrich the population over and over  plus capitalism has the flexibility to adapt evolve improve address its issues etc where marxism remains rigid and stagnant also the wealth produced in capitalist societies allows for the funding of the abundant social welfare programs typically touted by marxism personally i think capitalism works so well because it embraces human nature whereas marxism supposedly tries  and fails  to fight it
amen brother
war is peace greed is helping others freedom is slavery ignorance is strength big brother is watching you
this speech was given in a conference designed for communists it could not have been delivered to a more wicked group way to go javier  watch your neck
mike drop speech
the truth and nothing but the truth
think i will move to argentina go argentina 
when was the last time you heard any american politician make a speech with such substance
milei for president of the world
well done sir
y cant they play it in its entirety
klaus shwabb who let this guy in
well saidthanksmakes me want to invest in argentina
he nailed itbravo
the wef is not about empowering the citizens of the world it is about enriching the elites
thank you so much for this i knew javier milei was a cut above the rest of the self serving i have subscribed to your channel and liked and shared your content which youve obviously worked so hard to produce i look very much to further content on this inspiring man 
i bet he wont be invited back
brilliantly articulate
why is this speech chopped  edited  it makes me question it  wonder about the editor
love it  the wef wiff
just seems like he made a speech for elon
abundant peace all  
china cant be forgotten achieving better equality and development results than for instances usa
the frame jumps are telling 
well said everyone is sick of it we are a democracy not communist or marxists like the wef how dare they sit there with their billions and plan to control us exactly they only want luxury and total control over everything else 
long live freedom damnit 
brilliantwe need more like this wonderful man
he is the donald trump of south america
i thought he was argentinian not indian
the problem is the wef doesnt want to make life better for people  they want significantly decrease the number of free thinking western people and increase control over who ever is left import people who are willing to get paid very little and are used to not having any rights  they are looking for the feudal economy
berlin 19 jan 241212pmthe protest of road hauliers against the increase in tolls and the co2 tax is taking place today in berlin the trucks managed to block berlin and several streets of the german capital two hours ago heading towards the brandenburg gate where a demonstration will be held in the afternoon which will be joined by farmers who are asking the federal government to withdraw the repeal of subsidies for the diesel for agricultural use geb  agenzia nova  all rights reservedunited_against_this_sick_system
argentina has been a drowning country for far too long held back by an odd admixture of totalitarian and socialist regimes  it sounds like they finally have someone in charge who understands the economic realities and just maybe they now have a chance to make some progress  oh  and no  you cant have the falklands 
this man is delusional 40 of argentinians live in poverty in the rest of the world poverty has increased as did the gap between the superwealthy and the remainder of humanity and what he means by collectivism
now im an ancient britain and have what a lot of people may consider to be a controversial opinion however this sensible gentleman has spoke more sense for the people of this planet that i would like to make a gift of the falkland islands to him and his country god bless you sir 
the man did his homework
milei knew that regardless of what he said he would never be invited to the forum again so he gave them everything at onceviva la liberdade carajo
javier milei with an indian accent 
thank you for your great talking points arrest klaus schwab and bill gates and these 2 criminals in a jail for life
bravo i couldnt contain my joy upon hearing this
hes kissing their asses here  not criticizing them  hes cool with wealth running things like a page out of an ayn rand book
how was javiers trip to the tunnel diggers in brooklyndont be bamboozledwho did he call out by name righthe literally just announced that argentina is open for purging lithium colbalt and uraniumhes no herojust a better actor than trudeauwho also sold his country out
these people are like but what about us we want to control everything
the elites cringe but have him as a dissenting voice wef goal for 2024 is to  build trust  but nobody trust the wef and never will
this is a serious warning not what hes saying because its obviously fake i mean a really crude fake although it seems to have fooled many of you the warning is that within a year a few years the difference wont be obvious youll have some wag posting concocted video of trump suggesting injecting bleach or shining a light down your throat to cure diseases asking his supporters to storm the whitehouse or a computer generated video of the british pm comically explaining that if you drop out of the worlds largest economic forum that wed have an extra 350m a day to spend on the nhs just think about where that could land us
word salad nothing more
hes an economist he knows what hes talking about
this man can be crazy enough to lead this world  a real world leader  hes not a lawyernot a greedy politician witch is rare  and speaks direct of the problems  cancel wef there still lying to you  incredible they didnt cut up his speach pre edited or pre narrate like they would do trump  now again they want your guns so when china takes over you cant fight back i would vote for this man to be a world leader stay alive please help this planet  for those who are blind this is the last year of america godspeed
great speech 
klaus probably shit himself during this speech
he spoke a load of rubbish in the 19th century when the west had slavery and usa also had robber barons who owned all of there politicians the people suffered extreme  poverty and uk had a extreme poverty that one of its world famous authors wrote books about it charles dickens so capitalism is a pyramid scheme for the elites
there is an error in the minute 101  he said argentina embraced collectivism in the past 100 years stating in 1900 the ai translation mentioned 1 year
truer words have never been spoken especially where and when they need to be spoken the most
macron and lula probably ll hate this guy
i do hope he has a fantastic security team go javier
america needs trump  trump 2024   capitalism
when youre right youre right
this is put out so that the sheep think wef does good
laissez faire is the economic solution for everything  overtime pollution laws old age pensions even weights and measures can be described as socialism
bolsonaro is pathetic compared to this guy go argentina
benny hill is back
ƒ±m from turkiye ƒ± love you milei  viva la libertad carajo
anyone speaking on that stage is spreading what the wef want
socialism and communism have and always will be the enemy of the west
if you had a time traveling machine and brought back one of the founding fathers of the united states this is exactly what they would have sounded like during one of their speeches this guy is a freakn gem and one heck of a glimmer of hope not only a glimmer of hope for argentina but for the world as a whole god speed argentinians protect this man with your lives
every european leader needs to listen to this man
the lion of argentina
if you cant own something you also have no reason to be productive other than through forceforced productivity will never be able to compete against selfmotivated productivity
bravo mr milei  we need more rational thinking people like you to fight this climate insanity to take over the world
wheres my comment
spoken like a boss i hope he can act on what he espouses
notice the logo the line goes through the letter o 3 times o is the 15th letter in gematria you wouldcould reduce this to 6 because 15 and so this would be the 666 forum
so ultimately this is part of the planned speech anyone speaking on that stage is part of the controllers plan to trap humanity
this is a fraudulent edit with many cuts on key pieces of information pathetic job i saw the original speech spoken in spanish and it was indeed amazing but please dont manipulate the ai english version
god bless you pr√§sident milei
wonder if this man wants a job in the commons britain could do with a man that can see the reality and incompetence of politicians around europe at the moment brilliant guy thanks for putting these nonentities in their place
what a speech
the marxist are slaves to an intelligentsia class that isnt very smart   think aoc
yeah right except for the most desirable standard of living on earth denmark norway sweden iceland the netherlands all democratic socialists  and they actually have more freedom than the totally capitalist counties  like  well there are none except for those where the gov totally failed like somalia  they tried this in chile when the scoundrels from chicago took over the economy and plunged it into capitalist hellthough i do find it detestable that the us gov attempts time and time again to punish tesla for being a fantastic successbut this is all old think these days are almost gone a degree of socialism will be a necessity when the effects of revolutionary tech like ai robots and medical advances bring on the world of super abundance despite the harping of politicians on both sidesif you really study history and mankind in general it is obvious that the leaders we choose are the main problem  we naturally choose psychopaths as the alphas and the time for this has long passed  time to start psychological testing of all political hacks and have them compete in tests and stimulated scenarios before the can even get on any ballot
we need more guys like this in all of our governments we need to expose that the wef and the who are nazi run organisations swarb and gates are nazis just like there fathers were back in tge 1940s both these organisations nerd to be finished and banned
an indian ai accent for an argentinian president 
after hearing this speech i can honestly say we can look for a better future on a global level eradicate poverty trough free markets and generating wealth
my new hero
this man is a genius in todays maddened world 
if you keep this up you will be able to buy the falklands
brillante milei pero por que le pusieron acento indio xdlong life freedom dammit viva la libertad carajo
brilliant
a leader who is so obsessed with dogmas and political ideology will fk up his country even more china gave up their political ideologies to embrace socialism with chinese characteristics under dengthe chinese leaders  are pragmatists and not ideologues the singaporean leaders are the samewe were not ideologues we did not believe in theories as such a theory is an attractive proposition intellectually what we faced was a real problem of human beings looking for work to be paid to buy their food their clothes their homes and to bring their children upi had read the theories and maybe half believed in thembut we were sufficiently practical and pragmatic enough not to be cluttered up and inhibited by theories if a thing works let us work it and that eventually evolved into the kind of economy that we have today our test was does it work does it bring benefits to the peoplethe prevailing theory then was that multinationals were exploiters of cheap labor and cheap raw materials and would suck a country drynobody else wanted to exploit the labor so why not if they want to exploit our labor they are welcome to it we were learning how to do a job from them which we would never have learnt we were part of the process that disproved the theory of the development economics school that this was exploitation we were in no position to be fussy about highminded principles lee kuan yew
i really hope that this speech is widely heard and widely read throughout the americas and europe mexico south america spain and puerto rico will hear and understand it best in spanish for the rest i hope that accurate translations are broadcast and promulgated throughout the world because he appears to be one of the few elected unapologetic champions of capitalism to emerge in our modern times
i good start to exposing collectivism but what is his solution better or worse
globalist puppet mileis role for the public is exactly this rebuild trust false and staged trustsound familiaroh yes keep cheating yourselves
nonsense anyone economist or not left or right that tries to demonstrate that enonomy is a hard science is propagandising with his own concepts based on illusuary personal experiences
theres a few issues with this speech the biggest one being the usual mistake of looking at global per capita gdp from the 18 hundres and foward capitalism has its roots in the 16 hundreds from 16001800 global poverty increased dramatically with the birth of capitalism capitalism is not a flawless system it creates toxic incentives that makes people go over bodies the abstraction of time and human life into currency makes humans suffer greatly there shouldnt be single people with millions and billions making decisions that cost lifes without them ever noticing or caring we can come up with a better system over time im sure
dood man doin gods work
so much editing in it  i wonder what was actually said
klaus must be sweating bullets
this is ridiculous and can be stacked on so many levels
will he leave davos alive  
god bless you sir
love this guy
thank you farzad for getting this breath of oxygen out president melai was unknown to me but he has certainly raised the bar
yea but he forgets the goal is not prosperity for humanity but the total enslavement of it for the few
incredible speech
dont you just love this  i love it thank you for showing this on youtube i have hope with people like this  say no to nato and butcher biden  peace for we the people   
who is john galti cannot say that it is javier milei but i would not be surprised if he had copies of both atlas shrugged and the fountainhead on his bookshelf maybe even a copy of capitalism the unknown ideal also by ayn rand
love this guy
can we stop paying taxes now
there are always winners and looses this is nature and is normal and the solution is not socialism but charity love one anotherhelp each other
great to have ai now translating things and hes absolutely correct in what he says inarguable
even americans dont know this recent past presidents presidents dont know this trump must champion western style capitalism not just complaining about the opposition
such a well put speech i wish more leaders of countries could think this way
wowsouth africa is a perfect exampleof socialismcommunismensvthe past 30jr
colonialism is based on imperialism slavery is based on colonialism  capitalism is based on slavery  socialism is based on capitalism  communism is based on socialism  globalism is based on communism  imperialism is based on globalism  human history has no way out of this loop 
im argie i vote him he go to davos with only 5 other people in a commmercial flight
broke the internet  oh what a complete bullshit claim curb your drama
long live freedom dammit  theres a tshirt
free market capitalism has failed with next to no regulations the gap between rich and poor has done  nothing but grown and it will continue to grow libertarianism breeds greed and wants this growth to continuean example of socialism being more superior is the fact that russia after ww1 they started their industrial revolution they had the most amount of gdp growth than any other country in that 60 yrs their economy caught up with us of course there were a lot of social travesties under socialism  but that is as much a part of human greed as a deregulated capitalist system is meaning that a proper socialist system would be democratic and hold up individual rights keeping the power in the hands of consumer and voter in our current capitalist system which favours corporate welfare or corporate socialism the voter and consumer have no power the government is bought and owned by corporate and globalist intereststhis man is a shill
i met you and your lovely producerwife in austin at the shareholder meeting after party  i like you more and more every day
 everything was all right until greed got in the way the human animal is so disappointing people are starving and unemployed as well as losing there homes in canada you need to update your statistics
to many fingers in the pie that is the problem
i am amazed this libertarian who has a masters degree in economics was even invited to such an anti liberty  get together  i do hope that milei can at least rid argentina of the huge debt it has and  that that state can once again return to be a wealthy nation that attracts business to its shores
globalism is evil and poisonousits unaccountable and unelectedin a trully democratic world this is totaly unexceptable im british and i want our establisment to drop the wefunwho euechr and bring back full control back to westminster and full accountabilitythis is truth democrscy not the treason the british establishment is ramming down the british electorates throat      freedom for the world  is in democracy not the wef vision of a bastardised form of communism
yes true free market capitalism non monopoly capitalismthe trump of south america
this is the work of the illuminati
i do not believe he was allowed to talk at davos freely i cannot trust this guy something is fishy
90  out of poverty completely false massaged numbers to endorse corporate capitalism and elitism and erase the concept of the one percent
vamos peluca viva la libertad carajo
and yet at the end of his speech he claimed to be their strong ally so i am unsure about this man  he blows this big horn and then submits to the wef at the end  time will tell and show what  his true colors are
the statistics for capitalism are linear progressive and a steady rate of multiplied growth are produced in a way to be the easiest multiple for the lazy mind to be fed and are completely false
he assumes these people want individuals to have more wealth freedom and longevity  doesnt he know where he is
very clear and sensible would avoid what so many leaders have pushed over the years what they think will be a solution and it has ended in disaster
he has to put his money where his mouth is and get rid of the argentinian central bank and the legal tender laws
what history book is he referring to
that is fucking crazy that you can translate it like that
this man should be a leaderhe has got it right
we have lost our values and now we are only producing poverty
america needs a leader like this man  he is amazing
everyone need to hear this
who owns the bank is the real  leader leading prosperity or disparity 
what a great speech he wont be invited to the caviar and champagne party at davos again
um no man  this is not the greatest speech ever  javier milei simply repeats all of the classic libertarian talking points deregulation is the key to worldwide economic wealth while at the same time throwing in a healthy dose of racism and misogyny but for social justice initiatives and feminism the worlds gdp would be higher   my wife and i love you farzad but youre wrong on this one
love this man now this is what the world needs
freedom  freedom of worker unions
the ai even gave him a genuine argentinian accent  amazing
klais swaub should not be in any position of power due to his corrupted ideology which only serves to harm the human race istead of helping it
this argentine leader is 100 correct   but also the lord jesus christ  god said all of this when he was alive    knock and the door will be opened    seek and you will find  peter put down the knife those who live by the sword die by it   democrat party and liberals scoff at the lord which is why we have big problems worldwide rn   would it kill yall to follow the 10 commandments  just read them
congratulations argentina your ppl are smart   
it seems that parts of his speech were censored and cut off from the video by youtube 
even though hell turn argentina around and they will begin to prosper again the socialists will still slime their way back in
he is a showman a zionist wef actor just watch what he does everything he said he would do like close the central bank he does the opposite and his face speak more then million worlds what kind of person he is
great leader finally the truth is out tribute to robert welch
this guy is a psychopath
how do we know ai hasnt been used to generate the entire forum
is this really him talking i thought his speech was originally in spanish
they are completely against everything that this brilliant young leader stands for
great courageous speech 
this man has huge cojones
obviously the devils dictator schwab had a thought error when inviting this sane man well done javier you are a true hero in a world full of psychopaths in power
i bet that made some reptiles uncomfortable 
excellent
givem hell harry
there should be a world regulatory authority for ai developments implementation approvals categorised as ethical ai which supports and helps¬† humans¬† taskslife improvementother is unethical ai which replaces human jobs
i do believe that free market capitalism has outperformed socialism while free markets determine the best allocation of resources to satisfy consumer desire i dont believe that they provide what is best for a society i do also believe free market capitalism better serves those who most powerful or wealthy while those who are least powerful become exploited to satisy the tastes of the wealthy the end of capitalism is a caste system is the style of socialism where one caste controls the resources and influences government policy to their own benefit i believe both fail over a long enough timeline
good grief this is similar to when putin spoke at the  2020 wef protect this fellow 
i now have have a totally different opinion of this man he is a hero for stating facts and calling people to free themselves while standing in the center of the snake pit
here here what a great man  
given the venue this man has brass nuts i cannot believe they let him speak 100 spot on
effing legend
thank you argentina for this great and sane man these people are getting fewer these days great speech keep up the good work javier
some people in this world would burn the bible but praise the communist manifesto since karl marx and his book this world has gone totally in the wrong direction its the only book id burn
role playing kind of naive not to understand that he is playing the globalists authorized anti systemic outsider telling while blaming what the rolling misery plan is about
only academics can believe in something so absurd and those that can make you believe in absurdities can make you commit atrocities
not enough views to break the internet
it was good for imperialist colonialist and golbalist not developing small and third world countries
his english is perfecti love this man hes an amazing leader pure classgod bless argentina 
it is funny cash rules everything around me
 mexicano americas for trump  trump 2024
outstanding 
on the money sir
he wont be asked backtoo many home truths
how  i listen to his verbiage of contradictory terms and meanings how does this break the internet more like breaks your brain trying to make sense of it  ill make it simple for you he wants to facilitate the continued upward slope of wealth to his mates and sponsors through your ignorance  good luck if you live in argentina youre going to need it
well said 
a mixed bag there
this wasnt a warning ut was an update
it has to be translated into all languages
excellently expressed  respect what he had to say
thank you sir you show the reality
central banks need to be dissolved
its amazing how much has been removed
that a chad listen to this man and reject their bs
well hes telling the thing he was supposed to say damn it  the state is the problem thats why they let tell him all those things cause he embrace the destruction of the state ground welcome to world3
tell it like it is i am glad argentina got a leader
is not a libertarian is a real corrupt
he is spot on telling the truth is rare these days
am i believing my ears and eyes i cant imagine
capitalism is for the 1 percent at the expense of the 99 capitalism violates democracy furthermore wealth has not been generated but rather concentrated fact rich people have never earned the wealth they stole it look at your own ex president kitner what a liar you know why rich countries exist education baby you want to be rich get a education you need a mix system like europe and north america no market is without regulation this guy will only concentrate wealth while making the whole country is poor invest in education will make you rich
did you just reupload the entire thing with nothing added wtf
anyone else hear a little ayn rand coming through in his comments
the superhighway that leads to the gates of hell is paved with good intentions
bravo and touche
this was clearly edited by artificial intelligence do better as not to cut off important delivery of president milei
congratulations to argentina for finally waking up
god bless bravery this man is very brave
failed nato
boom
viva la libertad carajo 
another explanation would be that the economy grew during that exact same period because of the ever increasing extraction of fossil fuels which subsequently led to runaway climate change
im starting to realize that socialism is a lot like feudalism
roasted toasted they were melting inside their skinsuits
the ai even synchronized the lip movements and it seems milei was actually speaking in english soon i will not be able to tell what is real any more
banks shouldve failed but instead got bailed out so hypocritical
i am very happy for argentina i hope milei becomes the new simon bolivar and liberates south america from the leftists
capitalism only works if you remove the power of those who start far ahead of everyone else
the wef allow dissent now because theyve realised they are untrusted by the massesdemonstrating how open they are to free speech and opinion then the masses cheer on the man spouting traditional free market propaganda which is precisely the system that has brought us to where we are with an elite trying to impose collectivism on us in order to corner the market foreverwake up peeps
wow god bless you
 long live freedom dammit
wow what a great speech im surprised they didnt cut his microphone off
thank god we have him now as president because we were on the verge to become a huge slum thanks to corrupt socialist politicians he speaks   very good english but decided to speak in spanish he is a brilliant  economist with a wide knowledge in many subjectshe is courageous honest and humble he took a common plain and were accompanied by three people while the other corrupt presidents travel accompanied with sixty people and took the presidential plai long live freedom dammit
amazing
we absolutely love brasilien leader and his deep understanding of the problem that hinders  the world now and destroys bidenomics very insightful and 100 right
crazy you already lost
imagine joe biden trying to listen to this  hed be asleep within 3 minutes and wouldnt understand those 3 minutes prior to sleeping
im all for the message in this but it shows how impossible it now is to believe anything you see online or on tv we now have to get back to the only reality we can depend on the reality of personal experience
ok that was the economic arguments now lets hear the arguments about spirituality  about health about mental wellbeing
its absolute garbage which shows he doesnt know what hes talking about but since libertarians share the same stupid and incorrect view of the world and have their own madeup history which is a pack of nonsense and lies it will be swallowed down with glee
this was one of the most traditionally american speeches ive heard   thank god for people who are filling in the gap while we are waning  i hope we are not passing the gauntlet   let it not be
well said
the globalist cabal needs to be disbanded and all members put on trial for high treason  and orchestrating a plan for overthowing western countries democracy all those involved must answer for their crimes wef and george soros must be stopped at all costs
thank you for standing up to the wef authoritarian masters the usa need to vote trump american first to end the wef davos take over of the world globalist
in a world with finite resources perpetual never ending growth is simply a fantasy capitalists advocating for never ending growth regardless of any consequences are deluded to put it mildlynot to mention that globally we have effective socialism for large coporations and businesses saved again and again through state funding bailouts and favourable taxes etc while the elites on the contrary preach capitalism for the rest of us
bravo  speak the truth always
this is the new puppet of  the masonhe was in israel with  khakham to get the blessing of them in front of the holy wall dont be fooledhe is the new liar 
if he would talk about neofeudalism i could agree with him but as deceptive as he is he will not blame his overlords
didnt know 54k was breaking the internet this man sounds like someone who grew up poor and is just venting now
mate to say only capitalism drove economic development is just simple minded ask einstein newton or turing if they did it because they produced their innovations because of capitalism its just more complex
we have a better solution now auravana community standards we have an evolution from capitalism
people live longer in china and russia are you sure that capitalism works rents are higher taxs is taken off the poor heating is over charging on the poor loll 
this man is warning americans of what is happening in our country please take him seriously
any americans with some balls interested in moving to argentina
wef must have accepted him because they have confused him with somebody who promotes full scale fascism or neo feudalism
the free market leads to corporatisation and then globalisation  this is what we see now  most of the global power is in the hands of a very few corporations controlled by even fewer individuals unelected and unaccountable  who are deciding the future of the world via wef who etc
looks genuine but they trick us any way they can i wud only blive if i was there and saw and heard this could be deap fake
common sense without a whiff of elitist ether about it
will the cabal bump him off
proof the usa needs a president with backbone and younger with no senile crap
sorry nothe global economy is autocracies doing business with democracies it is not a capitalism vs socialism thingthe us enjoys all the benefit of having control over the global currency and the collective west is the collectivism of countries which get a slice from that economical advantagewhile at the same time the collective west has megacorporations so big that they are using cartel and monopolize whole industries so the collective west led by the us and the petro dollar is controlling the global market so it is not freeit is in the rights of those autocracies to balance out the free market by building alternatives to western financial systems and the total tyranny of the petro dollar because the west does not care about lifting up countries which are not 100 controlled by themif the intentions of the west would be sharing prosperity or lifting up developing nations then why the us is using the petro dollar to destabilize regions and to expand its influence beyond reason forcing those bad autocracies to abandon the dollarsorry but russi and china started to get rid of their dollar assets because the us started using it against them so where is the good intention the free market and the fair competition when the west does not allow it
wef is destroying all countries folks in the usa will leave the country if goes fulltime socialism with communist
no more false narratives  freedom for all people no more lies fake science  we want real food not gmo or rotting produce  what is being made available  and the ability to tell the truth    censored 
perfectly said right 
gratitude
viva
if he believes all this why has he turned his back on brics
is that robin williams playing dress up
well intentioned 
this man may just turn argentina around and make it a firstclass example of freemarket superiority klaus schwab we really dont need your elitist socialist solutions you may mean well but youre the problem
came because scott adams talked about this stayed because the sound of brass balls clanking is so musical to my ears
wow impressed
your banker are listening to your history lesson youre just wasting your time you must pay imf and wb interest on your loan
what lifted 95 of the worlds poverty which world is this the western world capitalism is important but also needed to be controlled why else would there be apple facebook google that controls the whole market they could buy or kill smaller capitalist off the market and continue to dominate this is also killing growth stopping capitalism dominance is the first killer of growth just ask your own people
looks like the wef has gone into damage limitation mode for now but dont be fooled they are not done with us yet
nigel this guy should be your new best friend
wake up the silent majority and dont ignore is explanation of the world today
to argue that there exists no discrimination against women or that environmental pollution and destruction isnt a thing is just plain idiotic
anyone got the original in spanish  its annoying for the native speakers
thats the speech of the year mr president
this person must watch his back many nazism in argentina  god bless him
the problem is the distribution of the wealth we basic should have universal income
if socialism worked we would have heard
amazing like thi search for heritage president goes scorched earth on globalist elites on wef
this man reminds me of 1970
creepy guy   
the money lenders tribe love this guy for his love for exponential growth
hes the man god bless him
broke the internet with laught 
i love this man 
this guy sounds intelligent in economics at a logical relm
brave and free
venezuelan communist dictator nicol√°s maduro made a recent speech highlighting humanitys technological development and the emergence of ai which he considered dehumanizing and urged young people to combat it and fight for a more humane world well without ai we would not be listening to javier milei in english or in any language other than spanish with this speed and ease
great speech but wow this videos use of ai to dub it into english with a fake ai voice even with accent and lip syncing is at once very impressive and very creepy ive never heard him speak before and didnt even realise his voice is fake until i looked up the full speech sort of thing that makes me wonder if ai should be in a free market or highly regulated and watched like a hawk
finally one more honest politician this unique man needs to be protected at all cost
this guy is the ronald reagan of argentina
smart man i wish we had a lider like that
what he doesnt understand is that the resources required for free market capitalism wont last forever growth can only take you so far
the truth you need a fast horse
when the state bails out capitalism failure it is not  the free market  its corporate socialism
055  that was an interesting glitch  its almost as if someone wanted to deliberately change the message from argentina has been declining for the last one hundred years under socialism to argentina has been declining for one year  im sure it was purely a coincidence  
no applause 
its interesting that he is there telling those in the audience what they really already know the perplexing question is why all the sudden give this guy a platform there no invite to elon i think its confusing or on purpose could be throwing people off the real agenda by appealing to itchy ears where the intended targets stick their heads back in the sand its interesting he has this platform here and more so raising suspicion due to association he very well could be well meaning and he is there for my previous speculation its very opposite to the past stance coming from this organization
isnt it special that someone outside can see the truth beyond the restraining powers and social media that is controlled by  
champion 
fantastic keep going javi
problem is argentina cant compete in a capitalist system in 2024
i am having non of this why china is so rich financially and why argentina is begging china for finances i can see the blue eyes a d long nose there
expose what neomalthusianism is
wow  why cant we have leaders like this instead of the propaganda puppets under w e f  how did he get on this stage
wow i think that counts under oversimplyfication  of course you can pick together only the historical facts which support your argument and twistet worldview but there is a whole other side on this coinand im not saying that i dont agree with some points he makes but its a political speach in the coat of a pseudolecture so dont be misslead he is a politican and like all politican he alsow has an agenda he is no truthseeker or something
beautiful just beautiful
amen
a star is born
reduce corporations very simplereintroduce domestic manufavturing and robust self reliance within countries focus on the german concept of mittlestand and economies will thrive like never before
this is why we say putin you dont arrest simple protestors for speeking out you dont oppress any one  but you jioned xi and kim freedom is what makes us so strong with capitalism
bravo 
o my theres a whole bunch of omission here unfettered capitalism leads to the same kind of oppression of monarchies
he speaks wise words
well said javier millei
god bless him for saying truth  
im moving to argentina
defacto not de jureget out
haha this is interesting this ai translation is much better than the translation dubbed on the official wef video
all leaders are corrupt to a certain set of people to avoid a world collapse we need to realize this we are not in the time period of steam engines live stock and grain sales supporting capitalists thirst for wealth capitalism can only exist if there are poor people to keep it lifted its time to wake up
mr mieli congratulations   on wellspoken speech thanks for giving the truth and strength back to the people 
oh my god this man actually can make a decent presentation i thought he is simply a joker well argentina may is not in a very bad spot after all though his economic is still suck from my point of view demolishing central bank switching to dolar based currency system leaving the country to winds and waves of others with less power of control over the economy
there are a few troubling things about milei that most people outside of argentina are not aware of to begin with hes a staunch supporter of israel a murderous oppressive racist state currently executing one of the most horrific genocides in modern history so one has to wonder how that jives with the libertarian ideas he so boldly proclaims hes also closely linked to and sponsored by the jewish orthodox jabadlubavitch organization that was recently in the news for some serious incidents involving secret tunnels at its headquarters in new york with some very bizarre ramifications in fact he traveled there and visited said headquarters less than a month backits fairly easy to make bold speeches decrying collectivism unfortunately actions speak louder than words milei is not what hes made himself out to be he recently issued what has been termed as a megadecree which is virtually tantamount to a fullfledged constitutional reform that would give the executive full powers to do pretty much whatever it wants this decree has yet to go through congress which is under the oppositions control but in argentina thats nothing that cant be easily fixed with a few bribes however he might have to make some concessions in order to allow the opposition to save face the decree includes one obscure article whereby the president is given the power to invite foreign military forces to conduct operations on argentinean territory no mention is made of what forces those might be what the actual scope of their operations would be or how long they would be allowed to operate on argentinean soil so again how is that consistent with less obtrusive governance and individual freedom not to mention that it raises some serious questions about the mans allegiance bear in mind that argentina has the third largest jewish community in the world and patagonia was one of the locations considered by early zionist leaders for the establishment of the state of israel today it stands virtually defenseless as argentinas military has been scaled down to operational unviability to make matters worse it is very scarcely populated so please dig deeper question research dont be fooled by eloquent speeches investigate what goes on in back rooms behind closed doors
love love love great wonderful go go agree praying for  him
klaus does not want the populations of the world to be free fed housed or even alive which is why theyre trying so hard for the great reset and the death of half of the people of the planet this is why mileis speech is so explosive and its mind boggling that they allowed it to continue to its conclusion
this time around agentina is  in severe dept by the time they join bricks they will be very heavy to pull from the deep end of world bank pool of fools 
well said sir and bless you for not being a follower the majority of people in the world agree with you much respect  drop the mike and in your face world economic forum
the fed has printed 10s of trillions for banks and wall street since obama is that socialism or capitalism
like bailing out banks because the govt officials have stock in themthis man is 100 correct
he is correct
hero 
wow that man just said all that right to there faceme milei has big balls youi love what he told them salute mr milei salute
priceless anti socialism speech at globalist socialism platform 
we are making progress against evil enemies of humanity such as the wef however beware when  cornered they can strike back wildly in desperation the good news is that when evil has no place to go it turns on itself
i cant believe he said that  there is still hope in the world take good care about this man just not totally sure what he meant about abortions 
this is a real speech conducted by javier milei at the world economic forum ai was used to translate javier milei post from spanish to english and read in his voice
all these so called leaders will find out how much power they have when their money is worth nothing
vlad wants klaus dead
this speech is a masterclass on the benefits of capitalism this man is a historian and a visionary listen and learn well done argentinaand thank you
wow much respect for this man 
believe nothing and question everything  they used ai for translation think of landing on the moon
the pendulum swing back is happening
argentina is very fortunate to have this ethos expressed in their government
how come if you read his lips he is speaking english when the original was done in his own tongue   this video is questionable
why is the audio so choppy
greatest speak of a politician ive heard within the last 5 to 10 years
all american politicians are blackmailed and bribed
so refreshing to have a person of this stature and absolute knowledge of economics stand in front of that logo and speak of reality we need more of these leaders from previous communist states who lived under communism give a blast of reality to the makers  governance of woke dom  who have over ran our institutions with idiotic legislation all under the guise of social justice which in fact is nothing to do with sj and everything to do with controlling compliance division and removal of people with a different narrative what a speaker 
well said but will the communist wef listensadly not they will ignore how they all got their wealth they will proceed to increase control and push marxism and aim to reduce populations by their evil agendas  psalm 2 they will someday learn that they are not god
the white hats are in control were watching the dismantling of the elitistsglobalists agendaandit cant come soon enough
fake
and yet here i am seeing this on the internet thanks for making this easy adding forbes to the list of hyperbolic fake news outlets
is that ai
and not have western fascists control nuclear technology research in the name of security it is all nonsense
global speech 
im sure that no one at the world economic forum including the owner and all his cronies expected this speech by this person for sure there are secret people in the audience that are only there to secretly video tape and record the goings on of this most disturbing forum
if hes so good why is he at wef
i suspect be will not be invited back next yearand if he is its be interesting to see if he has changed his tune
wow
this is ai
corruption is generated in all systems where deductive problem solvers exists the best systems we can adopt is those that weed out the worst kinds of corruption and allow the best system to emerge and adapt to fight corruption
wasnt this speech in his native tongue it looks ai generated 
party on in davos next year 
brilliant  thank you
long live  freedom    stop ocupasion world

viva  milei viva argentina stop agenda 2030 
what world does he live in
well said sir 
real men so refreshing he has given me faith and hope respect from canada
good on him
free market capitalism is the  my parents suffered through socialism its no picnic truly owning nothing and starving everyday
god save this man
the wef devils did not expect this trump did the same and is no longer invited  well done javier 
this is a fake speech done with ai
hear hear from a uk citizen
did he say that in 1895 argentina was the worlds dominant power only in the measurement of gdp per capita can argentina rank above other western nations in 1895  their descent to a thirdworld nation status was rapid thereafter surely the problem with the elite gathering at davos is that they do not wish to see individual freedom and wealth increase in the world they wish to control all aspects of individual freedom and introduce a new feudalism neofeudalism so that they can control economies to their own benefit
fascist
thank you for sharing hearing this gives us hope 
jesus is in nunawading
astounding speech what an amazing and competent leader i am jealous of argentina we need more leaders like him everywhere
his is godsentand more good human vil kom to talk about  the wef
as an expat in argentina since 1990 ive seen it all socialism has destroyed the economy and society go milei
1533 i agree that the controls the means of production definition is outdated its so important that he pointed this out
long live freedom dammit
this dude just worked klaus like a speedball
id  love to hear prof hudsons  response  view also will argentina get choked by imf loans etc  amazing speach will eu listen  haha
i love the way the world is going at the moment
bravo argentina
i just listened for a second time and now i have real concerns for this man future and personal safety i fear that there could be an assassination on the cards in the near future in argentina and yes i am looking at you agents of the cia and nsa we know who carries out 90 of all assassinations in the world overthrowing governments and targeting world leaders who dont conform with the western socialist agenda
its argentina trying to fix itself
this guy gets it however they will ignore him and say he is an ist or an ism telling the truthin other wordshe told them the truth to their face and will be labeled an extremist and ingoredinstead of listened to normal in the world of im rightthe world is wrong malignant narcisssim crowd
9501055 thank you i love that someone finally said this
wow ai translated this
freedom first
the point is free market capitalism not monopolized capitalism which is why the us is going down the shithole  we are turning away from free market capitalism to an oligarchy type monopolistic capitalism  the few big corporations have manipulated the government in a way that makes it impossible to have true free market capitalism  so many laws and regulations have been imposed that it is virtually impossible to start a business today unless you have a lot of cash to just set it up where it meets the hundreds of regulations
he is saying millionaires and billionaires are worried about poorer people and hes making a case for the nonmillionairs to be controlled and eliminated in the name of capitalism
free world 
his message is crystal clear and reveals the devastating plans and policies coming from all the neo x individuals in wef eu un who wto world bank washington dc etc
i think the umbrella factories just produced their ricin addition umbrella on sale i imagine those will sell out pretty quick unfortunately it may not repeat but it rhymes
excellent man spoton very brave
communism failed now they going after the world
communism solocualism not
who susppossed to do that
wow according to the media this guy is crazy couldnt be further from the truth
im surprised they didnt cut his mic we need more articulate intelligent leaders like this 
bullshit
wisdom is  talking 
i am sure many will not agree with my comment but i will type it anyway a free market economy has created a wealth disparity that is heading us back to the wealth structure of the eighteenth century where most people were effectively slaves for the landed gentry just because gdp grows does not mean most of us are better off than our parents the middle class grew out of the end of ww2 as home ownership which is the cornerstone of being middle class and peeked around 20 years ago modern day poverty always seems to be measured in monitory terms but there are other ways to measure poverty loneliness bad health no future prospects to name a few which are becoming endemic in much of the world the amount of money now in circulation is now around 280 t which is why gdp increases but as a planet we are dying and simply increasing the speed that money moves around the planet will not bring the end of poverty for the majority
argentina does have alot of issues were good at one time
you know i bet just about any system would work well enough and its the people that are running the system that f it up so if you had ethically moral people in charge running things it would probably work i reckon but we wont know because of humans dont seem to want to get better or improve much maybe its because were still running on old hardware for new times guess the future holds the answers hopefully
amen  brother
capitalists enabled poor people to own a smartphone socialists still deport starving families into death campschoose wisely
what a great speech  this guy is absolutely brilliant and 1000 right  long live argentina with milei  down with all the hyporcrites of the wef 
power to the people
the nuts on this man are as huge as my respect for him for standing up to the ultimate schoolyard bully with such eloquence and intellect i applaud him
amazing speech 
disgraceful use of ai
 the best mr presidente j milei 
lucky to listen what j milei is talking about i m a strong supporter of libertarianism and milei speech mirrors my understandings 
the problem is that growth will kill all of us you dope and what are you commentors on here thinking your not
this guy just got onto king nutjob charlies hit list
its so truehere in ireland we have a left wing government propped up by far left activits ngo class and lgbt lobbyists our country is overrun by champagne socialism and theatre in parliment its time for change the record
finally a great man who understands the big picture
this only works with increased consumerism that enriches the elites who produce thats why he was allowed to speak
this guy is brilliant 
unbridled capitalism is bad
apparently you are not aware of chinas progress a communist country now practicing socialism
fantastic speech
this is edited watch the original
its to bad the main street media wont cover this or the truths he is spitting
wow he is spot on he said absolutely nothing controversial youd do well to like this speech because hes advocating for you yes you
wef afuera
laughable at best you wanna have less children capitalism you wanna have most nations wealth in the hands of few people capitalism bring war to everyone on the planet destabilise global free market with sanctions of mass destruction capitalism my point is there is no silver bullet
ha ha what they do is not socialism is fascism socialism for the rich capitalism for the poor the intention is not to offer everyone a decent standard of living through equal distribution of wealth access to resources equal representation through laws sharing the means of production just look at the wealth distribution world wide the wealth transfer towards the 1 we are headed towards modern feudalism not socialism
wow just wow what a great speech and much needed
i am very happy for argentina
how narrow a viewpoint
robin williams what makes a great movie q
this is ai manipulated
you people are ruining the internet with this type of crap but of course you cant see it
yes i heard about his speech and its great to hear its true capitalism is the only way for nations to grow and prosper
so lets make the world better  
capitalism only can take world to better place by real life
protect this man at all costs hes holding everyone on his shoulders he is amazing much respect
dont be fooled  the guy is a hypocrite and a wolf in sheeps clothing
amen  a voice of reason and the reality of the best system in the world
this should be played in every classroom in america
very well said with truth  conviction in my country we dont have any elected official who would say these truths to unelected entities such as the wef who imf wbo un etc etc sadly australia is a signatory to all of the unelected elite run cartels 
javier has missed the point that there is such a thing as corporate communism huge corporate institutions can control stock exchanges and underlying markets making it impossible for small businesses to set up survive and grow like blackgrass parasitically inhibites the growth of wheat it steals nutrients from the roots this is what happens to small business
good to see clear and articulate public discussion of such fundamental ideas
ai
the lives of all of depending on a bureaucrat sitting in an office is a scenario that will also inevitably appear if the market is too free as companies which become monopolies will have too much power and control over peoples lives  the government may have a monopoly on violence but in this scenario the corporations have a monopoly on soft power and can restrict freedom just as easily something fishy is going on here  almost seems like the massive companies and businessmen comprising the economic forum have unleashed the fear of socialism on the population in order to spark a kneejerk reaction by the populous involving going as far from that path as possible a totally free market leaving their own investments free to gobble up smaller competition and gain more wealth and soft power
i think there should be some indication that the speech was in spanish
javier believes the opposite of what they believe when they hear about the right to life freedom prosperity for working class people freedom of speech and the creation of families that can procreatethey get nauseous long live javier milei 
a true hero of our time when someone speaks plain truths and is considered a hero for it well that should be enough of an orwellian warning  no more compliance
bravo 
bravobravo
idk if my thinking is right i love capitalism but talking abouth gdp growth when you are printing money seems to be very strange or is this calculated taking such things into consideration we do not have free markets theyre regulated not by the consumers but by governments and the governments incentivice and benefit some and harm others and it has been found to often not be in the interest of the consumers or progress instead of greed and self perseverance
 this man every time he speaks the light of understanding is definitely with him
this is how the wef will die its on its last legs and the founder looks dead already
im moving to argentina 
what a wonderful man  i hope argentina becomes successful  then the rest of the world can follow his good example
this man will lead the purge of corruption
works fine until its corrupted
what an amazing speech challenginh the status quo defintiely opened many eyes this speech should be listened again and again  theres so much gems in this speech bravo millie
bravo sir
this guy got good ideas  if i am elon i will move to argentina  sounds like he is describing the how biden administration ruining america
the west needs more javier mileis
its a simplistic view of reality while the wealth of a country would be maximized many people would be left behind like always balance is important
ok i get the speech was dope how the fuck did ai get the mouth movement so on point
this message needs to be spread thanks for this translation and an upload
taxing labor and basic necessities like food or shelter or medicine or healthcare or functional clothing is a crime against humanity taxing of labor is directly indentured perpetual servitude to the ruling government a crime of brutal human slavery it is corporatism a vile construct the devours our humanity we must as a human race adopt the values of the individual a model that is the base of the constitution of the us established by we the people we do not have this ideal held today it must be restored ml and blessings all
hahaha this is same as when ricky gervais was host in hollywood oscar night when he destroyed them in the face
this speech has been censored and edited
once upon a time the catholic church was against communism now it seems tohave joined the partygod bless this man for speakingtruth in the uk we are taxedto death
bravo 
he basically just told wef to foff
free market capitalism  data dont lie   quality of life   you a genius   utube is  hot
i could counter every single argument he has
i need to move to argentine give it a few years for him to turn the country around
i think i might move to argentina
the question becomes how do you change the structure that is in itself corrupt to embrace the beneficial moments to the minority what do they do to stop the poison that is damaging a society
state intervention by central bank issuance is the current problem with the market leading to the cost of living crisis caused by the inflation created
how brilliantly said  only the audience was probably rolling eyes and sleeping
are we really going to become a politics channel now
shelter food and healthcare is a privilege not a right if you cant afford it bad luck
some of the wefs largest donors include
ok he is also a klaus schwabs wef marionette good try what did he on the background
the same guy who doesnt want anything to do with brics talk about confused logic globalist controlled opposition puppet why else would he be in davos or given a platform sorry but this is as much nonsense just like everything in davos
wow very well said i cajt believe he got up on stage and said all this because i understood that wefun are the opposite direction are they trying to be open minded and show both sides of leadership
he may be a newage politician but hes an economist and if hes allowed to work his way with argentina he will lift his country out of the socialist hell hole they have been in for 4 decades  support this man  the wef hate him  i love his morals 
wow that is amazing speech
spread this video as much as possible thank you sir you are a breath of fresh air  let us live our own lives and leave the animals alone  get rid of plastic  
i dont understand  in some places he speak spanish and here in english 
absolutely  100 
can someone do an russian version and post it many ukrainians are completely clueless about whats going on in the west
great show from a man whos country is completely dependent from the iwf its just a show
free market capitalism is wonderful   if only it could be implemented   the best you will find is crony capitalism and goods created in other countries under communist rule and employment sent to 3rd world countries  free market capitalism only works if the capitalists are incentivized to create wealth for the home countrywhoops  as it stands  they simply seek cheap labor elsewhere and we import goods from china  its a real dream yeah right   it works so well that all but a few are engaged in criminal activity of one degree or another  lawyers and judges go where the money is not where the justice is  realestate is highly limited and everyone knows it  billionaires who owe all their fortune to the working class who buy their products and create them rarely give back what they take under denial of creating jobs  amazon created only one thing  dead end jobs that cant pay for a shack and fuel for china  its a great dream  but welcome to reality  the only reason im not starving today is because i finally gave in and sought government assistance  which is socialism   americans are not starving because of socialism  which is paid for by the few rich people who do pay back
what an absolute legend
best speech ever
will argentina be able to come out from the debt trap of the imf  forget about socialism vs capitalism  argentina only need to work on good governance control your spending  ensure your people have enough food to survive first and keep your big mouth shut 
this video is fake his mouth is faked if they can do this and anyone thinks this is not all part of the wef agenda then you need to open your eyes
tell us more about trickledown economics and how you caused the great depression the homeless in the united states thank you
why are some words being cut in the middle pretty annoying
brilliant speech  liberty for all
he almost makes me wish i were argentinian instead of american  almost but hes right 100 percent right
bravo sir this man is a will be remembered as a voice of freedom
muh magical free market fixes everything crap  it simply doesnt work  a balance is needed
brilliant   
capitalism or crony capitalism libertarianism or corporate feudalism to remove industrial subsidies or not to remove that is the question 
bravo
exactly what ive been thinking for years now  i think i want to move to argentina
fascism was always born out of liberalism never forget that
it is sad that there actually are people who agree with him
fact or truth with all the so called facts we are forced they are never backed with truth never has truth been backed by such facts long live freedom indeed
absolute gold
its just wrong to compare world gdp with hard currency gold backing up finance as an anchor to a world with a soft currency after the gold standarti expected a lot of him i heared he was an expert regarding economics but he looks like a fool when he compares this time with todays gdp most of growth today would be no growth without inflation he doesnt downplay it he actually denies the fact or ignores it
if you agree with him likeif you dont comment and explain why
211 inflation
let freedom ring
share share share and then share this some more people  get it out there
cant believe our socialist western elites allowed him to speak the truththe wef will do anything to silence him
viva la revolution y un mundo libre como dijo emiliano zapata prefiero morrr de pie que vivir arrodillado
jedi govna 
how truthful he was when he says that davos model  provides jobs for the bureaucrats he says  many  wise words on each of his  sentences breaking apart the davos craftily knitted net over society
is this an ai version did they actuallynlet him speak there  i cant imagine this to be true
in reality there are these people who think they are the the most important people on this earth and the rest are just here to exist for them to live like they are their servants with this wef is a real nonsense bla bla blabla no substanz at all
very succinct and backed by hardwon experience and statistics  i applaud you sir
they will try to eliminate him
god this is why you dont use ai instead of talking people voicing is just insufferable i had to mute iteither put captions either dub it properlyor learn spanish he is a really good speaker much better in original
awesome speech bravo amigioall you patriots please enlighten everyone you know about how evil  dangerous the world economic forum isklaus schawb  his cronies are a sick bunch
the argentinian economy failed more times than any other nation  because of rampant corruption on every level  putting capitalistic monopolies in place as he suggested will make that problem even worse
shocked that so many like this guy without drilling down into details he mentions the same ideas repeatedly without adding detail as to how this could be doneread ayn rand atlas shrugged youll see his idea represented there in this 100 year old book nothing new idolizing the free market and chastising collectivistic socialism which is a failed experiment from the 1920s that does not represent any existing government form today chastising regulation without explaining who could trust that an aircraft that hasnt met the many thousands of compliances in order to be airworthy i would not want to get on an argentinian aircraft that did not meet uptodate certifications and comply with the regulations of international bodies look at the crap buildings in turkey where a minor earthquake caused tens of thousands of deaths because inspectors were bribed and regulations were not followed fracking in the us is bad enough where we wont have to pay the price of the toxification of groundwater in many states for decades to come but imagine this on a larger scale with virtually all the groundwater and a lot of the surface water turned toxic no regulations isnt that great but we cant drink the water we cant breathe the air and the food in our supermarket is so laced with toxins that all of a sudden the health of our citizens drop off but we fired all the bureaucrats so we cant do anything about it we have succeeded in creating a bunch of wealthy people who been stashing their cash in switzerland then start thinking theyve done wonderful things when all theyve done is sold their country outdoesnt sound like this guy has thought any of this stuff through past history has told us that these idealized notions dont work is this guy smart enough to make changes on the fly i kind of doubt thats the case since he doesnt really have much of the basics down just a bunch of idealized nonsense
wrong free market is antimoral and prets upon everyone the powerful cannibalizes the weak
a leader of a country who actually cares about his people and humanity wow well said sir
means the forbes top hundret buy up what have you and play lottery abou it guess this speech is some tantra to neocons
keep falkland islands free
politicians are so pathetic theyll be using ai to replace them at some point and still get paid for sitting at home or playing golf
this man is beyond delusional we are living in a war full of war massive poverty and monopolies of the rich 1 literally holds more wealth than 99 the world have more than enough wealth to eliminate poverty forever no more poverty will mean no more acts of desperation and eventually no crime so why follow a liar who is so confident in his lie he can say its sunny when its a blizzard outside join the collective where your happiness is the priority once you experience the true freedom of the collective you will wonder why it took so long to do something so simple and the answer is simple you were brainwashed by the elite to think working will make you rich and like hamster you kept running if only you realized that the wheel has auto pilot and hasnt needed you for years
pm justin trudeau opposes everything that this  man rightly advocates and he rules canada with an underhanded communist style bloated government of small minded  twisted little people who punish the citizens with the heaviest of penalties possible on every occasion
terrific presentation thank you for the translation
i found his speech refreshing and different from the norm however i still believe that growth for sake of growth rampant capitalism is same ideology as a cancer cell it is just as dangerous as rampant authoritarian dictatorship we need to find the balance  what wipes out asian forests palm oil industry what destroys the marine life fishing industry pollution seismic testing pesticides in the water table from agriculture  big pharma  he seems pro corporations running things  worship the money work till you die
excellent congratulations president milei what a courageous and morally correct speech well done
if trump was smart like this guy id vote him
love this guy  can he come run scotland please
do you think he could stand as the leader of scotland 
capitalism worked until corporations like blackrock and vanguard bought up everything and made it a unfair and corrupt system that is just as big of a issue as socialism taking over they are both fucked up
milei talks of freedom and capitalism like he knows what they really are  capitalism leads to the rich growing richer and the poor growing poorer  eventually rich people will own the whole world if you give them the freedom to own everything and enslave everyone  rich people live like kings and queens and will never give up their wealth and power  rich people will kill as many people as needed to maintain their power over the world and many more as needed to make an example of you so you dont forget and overstep your bound  rich people wants to brainwash the mass to believe that capitalism and freedom goes hand in hand but that is to brainwash you to continue to support the current western society so that rich people can continue to get even richer until they own the whole world and have everyone enslaved  if freedom and democracy exists in a capitalist society that would mean that the people voted to be poor and enslaved by the rich and that people gave away their freedom as slaves while the rich has unlimited freedom to enslave everyone  nobody voted to be slaves and nobody voted for the few rich people to have all the freedom to enslave the rest of the people  the rich uses fear tactics to get people to support the current capitalist system  the people are so brainwashed by the ideas of democracy and freedom and the fear of being enslaved and losing democracy and freedom that they cant even see that they are brainwashed into supporting their own enslavement  milei is spreading the same propaganda to his people who are very ignorant of the world so they naturally believe any propaganda of freedom democracy and capitalism  if americans fall for the same propaganda of democracy freedom and capitalism it is very easy to see how the rest of the world can easily be brainwashed to support capitalism when it is falsely associated with democracy and freedom  when you have freedom and democracy you would vote for communism not capitalism because communism is about having a fair system that helps everyone equally  capitalism pretends to be the system that helps everyone equally but in practice it helps the top elites at the expense of the people  you can observe capitalism in america operating  the rich is getting richer and the poor getting poorer  the usa starts one war after another to siphon government debt into the pockets of the military industrial complex at the expense of american taxpayers  after the usa destroys a country it then lends loans for postwar reconstruction of that country  when those loans are defaulted the banks then owns those infrastructures and enslaves that country  this is how the rich elite americans pillage and enslave the world  if a country is a communist country the usa cannot debt trap that country and own that country eg russia  by promoting capitalism through propaganda of democracy and freedom the usa elites can invade destroy debt trap and enslave any country it wants to  allies of the usa are just puppets of the usa  these puppet governments are being bribed by the rich american elites at the expense of their people  milei is just another puppet of the usa  how much is milei being paid by the usa to sell the souls of his people to the american devils
yessir
absolutely stunning speech power to the people
this is not a real speech because milei made his speech in spanish and not englishif you manipulate the speech what is stopping you from manipulating his words
ron paul yall
who elected klaus schawb to run the world oh right no one
thanks for this video  this is the beginning at least an attempt to the beginning of the free world  well done argentina
this guy is a true hero freedom thanks ehhhh
finally 
best thing ive heard out of davos since trump was there
the trump of argentina  viva  now see if you can push back on jorge bergoglio one of your citizensalso trying a catholic church reset
damn that last line went hard as fuckdo not yield to the state the state is not the solution it is the problem its self you are the true protagonist of this story you have argentina as an unconditional ally
i believe this is bs
finally someone with common sense and balls to tell them truth i grove up in one project  behind iron curtain and now they are already creating another one 
what a breath of fresh air turn your country around brotherend their evil and show the world and be the example for many other countries to rise above and become great and independent while flourishing as they all should god bless your mind and journey
great speech but wildly out of touch with reality we have far too many examples that illustrate that capitalism leads to corporatocracy and this is indistinguishable from authoritarian rule it is scary enough when considering how a company like coca cola would rule when it owns the legislature but we clearly see what happens when military industrialized complexes play this game to maximize profits they need to make war as with all things in life the solutions are in the middle
suck an amazing ai job but i wonder if the people in the comments know about it and dont mind or dont even know about it
who is this guy
i love this guy i cant believe that he is the 1st libertarian ever to become president of a country what an achievement and a great opportunity for argentina to rise up
some of what he says is true and i also like individual freedom but free market capitalism cannot exist without the nation state or government if there is no government theres noone to punish theft or robberies for example making free market capitalism impossible and you instead get anarchy you want your government to be limited and respect peoples right to freedom and privacy like usa in many red conservative states practiced a few decades back and run by biblical principles capitalism is close to biblical principles in many ways but upholding biblical values and faith is what the country really need if you want to fix the west get christianity back in schools it straigthens out so many things not just economy but also family values care for poor people 
it is very strange  the usa is a republic
there are a lot of blips and false lip movements
the speech was in spanish
dios le ha dado un verdadero l√≠der a argentina
wow  im surprised that he was able to make it to the end without the plug being pulled out a cat amongst the pigs 
mi presidente
he can tell it to the illiterate person not to the current fully informed society look at russia they are already celebrating as the top of the world with sleepy zombie on power and the capitalism makes capitalists and politicians rich and the common people will remain poor for ever poor people and homeless people in us is the proof
i think argentina needs to sort itself out first and then say hay look what we didwe can then see if his solutions to the very specific argintine problems are on a net basid good average or a pile of shitso until then shut up and get to work and oh by the way you will not be getting back the falkland islands very soon either if you try a venezuala on the british you will get a storm shadow cruse missile through your bloody window no negotiation or long winded discussions
we all know how the mainstream media works they will start talking shit about him in the future trying to destroy his reputation lets stick to independent media its much more trustworthy and man  that was a legendary speech long and prosperous life to milei
yep the gov is fucking us dry
did he really end this with long live freedom damnit lmao
i thought he is a friend of usa 
his speech is supported by argentinian history and path they had chosen that led down to their downfalljavier is only the representation of the ppl of argentinian waking up to the bs of socialism and communismmind anyone please that it is the people of argentina that elected him as president and speaking now here on this stage is the voice of his ppl thru 100 year of history of stupidity of socialism and communism
canada in a nutshell our dollar was almost equivalent to the us dollar at one point people were thriving travelling trading  now the country is dead and people are gathering to kick it  the naivety and passive aggressive stupidity here is on another level its well on its way steal as much from the government as possible and create as much under the table business as possible
i hung in there for 6 mins this speech was so lacking in nuance that it was basically freemarket rhetoric a mixed freemarket and socially democratic system has been proven to be superior to a purely freemarket based economy the countries that have implemented it well with a light and strong touch in certain areas have thrived and are some of the wealthiest economies in history this video wastes 1907 seconds of your time with a bad faith argument i decided to watch the whole thing in the end companies cannot govern themselves without the guard rails of sometimes extensive regulation they have proven time and time again that they will endanger the entire world economy by making the riskiest and craziest bets while experimenting on the entire world with said schemes and then with these failures they then run to the government to bail them out at the expense of the tax payer he mentions subsidies which the capitalist always will take and often lobby for killing the socalled freemarket which relies on true competition to weed out superfluous businesses and industries
legendary extra security please
god bless argentina with this leader
murray rothbard is smiling somewhere up there
outstanding speech by the newly elected president of argentina excellent english
anarchist thinkers such people are very popular in the 19th century they are the sharpest critics but they have almost no achievements in construction in argentina he is very dangerous soldiers will support him when they are satisfied but when they are not satisfied his life is like a dewdrop
wow milei is a well spoken amazing
that was a mastertalk speech 
congrats on 100k subscribers  you deserve it
farzad you are the manthis reminds me the talk hank gave in the courtneedless to say i am an ultimate unapologetic capitalism supporter
the best
argentina is the most lucky nation on the planet right nowthey opposed the always leftist socialist democrat marxist comunist real satanthey elected the only christian opponent to beat satan and as usual not a carreer politician abain who linerates the nation and lead it into prosperrity for all javier mileia very smart hero the argentine vivek ramaswamiand he slams the centre of evil wef a true criminal organistation
hahahahathis man will go down in history as abraham lincoln of argentina
the sentiments of this speech are why klaus is trying to work hand in glove with the multinationals he thinks by bringing them on board he can achieve the fascist ideal of national socialism on a global scale
actions speak louder than words
wake up people globalism and socialism doesnt work  it only ends up being communism
how to contradict yourself infront of the whole world speaks how losing freedoms is a bad thing then follows up by advocating against abortion rights which in itself is a freedom and then follows up with saying more state is bad which abortion ban is a state controlling your life and people find this speech as breaking the internetreally
chainsaw man is off the charts
la verdad dicha al frente de esa √©lite representada por mentirosos que buscan dominar al mundo y someterlo bajo su mando dios bendiga y proteja a milei
god bless
god bless the strong and the free
he want to their house and insulted them to their face i front of the whole world he probably just got jfkd
i no longer fall for great speeches i am very adamant in laser focusing on these groups of peoples actiins towards we the people world wide
this cut is horrendous missing words left and right
talk is cheap  results speak loader than words  argentina will probably be bankrupt within 5 years again the real problem is there is no real capitalism due to the corruption between politicians and corporations  the industrial military complex being the best example also politicians have discovered since 2008 they can just print money what he is really advocating is removing any safety net for people in society and incentivising the destruction of the environment i bet he is not getting paid on results like a true capitalist
long live to liberty  
i wonder why wef didnt allow comments on this video 
a real hero  viva president of argentina 
well  inside of 10 seconds he said socialism leads to poverty  which is absolutely false  libraries fire departments and armies paid for by taxes are examples of socialism in actionthose things lead to stability this guy must be insane
beautifully said
lol milei with a hindu accent lol
i just want to give this man a big big hug n kiss
viva argentina viva libertad

640 economic facts of freedom vs repression where individual property rights are respected
buy that man some beer  the truth hurts  iluminattischwab left the stage 
the truth is out i want to shake his hand and hope he runs his government like a company that serves the population like customers
thank you  shared
worlds first power in 1860  this guy needs a history lesson sheesh i agree capitalism is best and his message about communist ideals infiltrating many in the western world is spot on but is argentina the best messenger considering their economy blows chunks
superb what a great leader this guy will be for the whole western world
the woke freeloaders and elitists are pissed this guy just didnt get the message  you will own nothing eat bugs and be happy oh and  murder the innocent unborn by the millions it all makes sense huh
good intentions for positive changes is commendable tumbs up
i wish we had a leader like that in the uk
wealth expressed in gdp is far from a perfect indicator of the wellbeing of humans too many people get sick and unhealthy from sitting in an office all day making toxic products that overwhelm the planet with waste and then are forced to spend all the money they earned by sacrificing their life and health on overpriced doctors and pharmaceutical companies who dont focus on making you healthy but on controlling your symptoms by keeping you just sick enough to keep buying medicines and treatmentall of these things are great for gdp amazing look at all that money being made and spent but very bad for real wellbeingdont get me wrong i dont say that capitalism is bad or that there is something else much better but its clear as daylight that capitalism alone is not enough for real wellbeing having the market regulators necessary to mitigate and unfortunately they can only mitigate not eliminate the effects of inevitable market failures leading to rampant pollution negative externalities doesnt fall out of the sky just like market products and services dont you need to fund these collectively im not arguing that socialism and very high taxes are better but it is obviously a matter of striking a balance between competing values and interests and hopefully we can get as close as possible to an optimal balance arguing blindly for only one side of the spectrum will not bring an optimal balance
speech of the decade or possibly the millennia
excellent use of ai
truth
powerful speechcalling it as it is on the world front
this prejudiced person apparently never heard of adam smith  smith properly identified capitalism as the fastest way to grow an economy but then he said the economy can become sated   when that happens capitalism has to morph or life becomes miserable  capitalism does not have to be abandoned in order for it to accommodate a sated status  by morphing to include some aspects of socialism does not require loss of entrepreneurship private property  or accumulation of wealth   currently this goes on in closely held private corporations
thanks for this service your farziness
i do not pay taxes on my own free will i do give to a church based on my free will
bravo
wow great speech
thank you argentina  thank you  for sending him viva argentina 
neoliberal propaganda i thought we were over this
a great speech and an amazing ai implementation
the people of argentina are in for rough times
thank you
god bless you
great and totally solid observations for a world that certainly needs to list right now his only mistake is in his prospects on world gpd the reality will be of a much greater economic output hugely empowered by the addition of the inevitable intelligent robotics
he made them all look like idiots
lots of slippery slope language  not every regulation leads to a slippery slope of more regulation for him it sounds like its either none no regulation no taxes no economic regulation no collective forced care for the poor no government regulation or services or were obviously headed back towards communist eastern europe 
spent a couple of years working in argentina 201214 in the christina years was amazed that the good people there could be so easily fooled despite their poverty of course that was before trump opened my eyes to our own american ignorance so i guess this idiot should just be fine maybe he can match the competence of brazil or venezuela pretty low bar
have been there done that meh no good
milei pointing  schwab has no clothes
voluntary collectivism for the good of the individual and the whole far surpasses the wealth production of free market capitalism  forced collectivism is the mother of mass slavery  capitalism is the mother of minority slavery voluntary collectivism is the mother of life and true freedom
great video editing it actually looks like these are his words what is the software please
ok
we are humans and nothing will stop us from destroying ourselves capitalism communism fascism nothing works we have tried everything and all has failed
to all  the people of the world i feel it i feel the change coming do you
fucking legend
capitalism is not the way forward at all
socialism  power concentration  repression  death
i too thought libertarianism was onto something when i was a child many many years ago
it works great until it doesnt  like in 1929  if its working for you i am happy for you  its not really working for me and definitely not for all of us
thanks farzad
wow this is so insane and wrong
congratulations farzad  for 100k mark and thank you for posting this video
god bless this man and his message 
the higher the tax burden the greater the coercion leading to a reduction in freedom
this garbage can be left to other forums i reckon we are forced to pay taxes do you feel forced farzad i pay taxes to live in an awesome country and live in peace nz in my case there are many places in the world you can live and pay no taxes none of them are nice none they are dangerous and violent this simpleton libertarian argument is for the basics that dont really like to think too deep they think tax is just stolen money by some unknown entity go see what its like to live in a low tax or no tax country the highest taxed countries are generally the happiest nordic european nz au etc
elon are you listening here is an invitation for next gigafactory in argentina
dont only talk action first growth argentina economy
the danger to western country is the only international element hell bent reshaping the world under 1 government they control so they can usher in their messiah
this is stupid theres nothing wrong with capitalism as long as there are guardrails same with social programs and social justice any system thats pure doesnt work there has to pragmatism and this authoritarian doesnt understand that there are more billionaires per capita in scandinavia than the united states garbage speech
such a great speech
we are having a market failure in canadian housing turns out the government regulations cost more then building the house
hes effectively arguing for the unfettered exploitation of humans and the planet its naive and dangerous to think that state regulations are not needed but by all means try it in argentina and see how it works out cant get much worse than it already is
capitalism is the modern version of corporate feudalism via usurysocialism is jesus new commandment love each other as i loved youbeware the global corporatism capitalism fascists who supply the world on many waters  ride the chines dragon for we are in the day of lot  noah not due to you or co2 but rather the mystery of he 7 stars jesus held in his hand
nothing mentioned about the pollution the environmental destructionspecies extinctionall measured in gdp but at what price 
one word externalities capitalism only functions when externalities are not addressed be it financial ie stock market manipulationenvironmentally super fund sitesmedically the worst medical care program in the 1st world
bravo javier
sweet sweet music to my earsand delivered impeccably in the perfect location  
well done sir i hope the worlds  ears open to ur suggestions
funny i watched it earlier with text subtitles watching the ai translation is amazing pretty seamless
thank you farzadviva elon
if you dont like free marketyou are probably a loser that want everything without giving anything
im sure close schwab is regretting crying in his beer that this man so intelligently attack everything that the world economic forum stands for globalism a super elitist group controlling the worlds population
why is the wef telling the truth this is very suspicious
lets go d
especially as it happened at davos
he just described jack ma  elon here in the usa 
embrace liberty thank you for sharing
the free market is the answerwithout government armies to be only 20 of gdp
oh my god we still have hope
i would have loved to see the audiences faces as he spoke too  great speech but hes in the belly of the beast
utterly astounding  he covered it all in just under 20 minutes  flawless logic i am thinkingi am reminded of a quote  democracy is the worst form of government  except for all the others  winston churchill 
the free market fails often  our government has been chasing and trying to mitigate the problems of capitalism since the beginning  we needed to bust the trusts monopolies create unions and create laws and regulations to protect us from poisons and environmental damage  this fool ignores that the most prosperous and happiest nations are a mixed economy
why does this look so fake
i had no idea he could speak english
excellent presentation may he be successful let us all help him succeed  
damn this is some good ai
in the western world of old miles is so fond of there has always been a measure of socialism no country has ever been purely free not even the usa why because a purely capitalistic society without any safety net is the jungle only the strong survive while the poor is eliminated by natural selection the world envisioned by this man is brutal and completely devoid of any mean for weaker people or should i say entrepreneurs to survive thats what comes out of looking at the world wearing blinders
am i the only one getting american founding father fibes from this guy very impressive speach even if the translation was made with ai which ironically is also very impressive 
thanks for posting this
capitalism is great when its designed and regulated properlybut in the us that hasnt been the case since like the 1950syou cant say all wealth should go to the 1 and this is the best thing for the bottom 99 at the same time resource hoarding is killing us
amazing speech
bet you biden fell asleep 5 mins into this speech
thank you farzad for posting this people need to hear it these ideas need to be understood apathy is killing us
amazing to see people calling milei a nationalist talking at a globalist conferenceglobalist are by definition people who believe in taking down barriers to allow for pure and total competition between countries across the globenationalist by definition are people who want to protect their nation state and protect industries against global competitionman talk about getting things backward milei believes in true free market competition and total open borders for example he believes the mercursor agreement has been crafted to only allow trade between certain select industries in south america and not proper free trade  he may well be right he wants to tear down mercursor with proper open trademelei may say some bonkers stuff every now and again but he is certainly not a nationalistthe davos conference is all about ways to get countries to reduce tariffs and dismantle protections on trade if millei is lecturing the officials at davos then he is preaching to the converted if this is his way of making a statement to countries wanting to introduce more social protections  then it is a good speech
this is the most on point important speech ive heard from any politician in my life viva argentina 
didnt the ai learn in the us why the accent
so many variables
can we borrow javier milei up here in canada for a few terms  please 
the idea of a pure free market under libertarianism is laughable its like believing in unicorns cute concept zero chance in reality why because power vacuums dont stay empty someone or some group will always rise to the top and bend the rules to their advantage dont fall for the siren song of freedom peddled by charlatans like milei who promise endless liberty while building cages for the rest of us get real folks this socalled freedom would leave you worse off than ever especially if you were dumb enough to blindly follow these pied pipers to the slaughter dont say you werent warned
his most important point the fallacy of abortion rights  there is no right to kill unborn children
wait why is jesus eating with tax collectors and sinners where did you get this video
the biggest mistake is not to join brics
couldnt have said it better myself good stuff
bet ol rachel maddow loves this guy  hes amazing
how do i use socialism to upvote this a million times
china  russia are socialists and people are very well of the problem with pure caplitalism makesv few extremely rich and a lot of homeless people it leaves behind a huge percent of people destitute
milei prefers socialism for the rich not free marketshe uses libertarian rhetoric but is nothing of the sort the wealth gap will undoubtedly increase in his tenure civil rights will be eroded and youll all be wondering how did this happen 
looks like argentina has gained a huge advantage  capable competent government
this javier is amazing  nobody has the guts to just stand there and tell them the absolute truth  i truly hope that it will trigger some of them to change their views about the wef  i know chrystia  freeland is there and im positive that she was just constantly flicking her hair out of her face and bobbing  head and ignoring everything that he said  she is one person who is hell bent on destroying canada and giving all money to ukraine as being a ukrainian shes had a life long dream of being at war with russia now shes using canadian tax payer money to fund that war along with buying ukraine people massive yachts  javier is a hero for doing what he did for the entire world
awesome
the left will insist that all human relationships are based on power oppressorvictim etc but theyll neglect to mention that when talking of the relationship one has with themself in this instance the left tells people to trust emotions this then denies the individual a counterweight to the emotional domain with an intellectual accounting and opens the door to the emotional self oppressing the intellectual self this is what happens when ideologies stop short of their logical conclusion ignorance and often the thing that one wishes to avoid becomes the inevitable conclusion of a fragmented individual
thanks
read the 6000 year leap
pure truth
farzad as a side note this ai translation spanish to english using his voice is remarkable 
post slavery hegemony assertions
1240 he supports monopolies  we all agree that thats bad
last one who gave a speech like this was trump they declared war against him soon after
bravo
world economic forum afuera
wonderful speech and much needed for the world to hear
so good 
true 
amazing 
amazing
great english great speech
good fake bro  d
bravo
yeah gavin
is javier milei  just another herbert hover or viktor orb√°n or djt capitalism based on ayn rands failed philosophy makes socialism the boogie man fdr was called a socialist in his time yet he was left to pick up the pieces of failed capitalism that are again becoming unchecked before all the books are banned it might be wise to study some history and not praise other failed countries with charlatan leaders lmao on the title of this post for sure
this message needs to be spread as much as possible
pretty stupid his idea of not stopping monopolies 
why change the title it was indeed the greatest speech of the 21st century or maybe a historical speech from argentinas president would be a better eye catching title
the power of ai great use of the technology
but if we dont take care of the planet where will we live
i really like this guy he speaks the truth more than most can comprehend
wow  thats amazing
this is great  now i know how to condemn people to poverty  mooohaha  moooohaha

mire y aprenda aunque no creo que quiera ex canciller cafiero as√≠ se habla al mundo 
while he is correct about a lot here in terms of the benefits of capitalism there is a lot wrong here as well that he ignores i will focus on thiscapitalism like all things is not perfect and he does not talk about its problems one of the biggest is cost externalities in which people not party to a transaction bear a cost this sounds academic but it manifests for example as mine owners dumping tailings into a river drinking water and fishing  each being forms of natural wealth  are depleted to save money for the mine owners perhaps less than is nonconsensually extracted from the river users protecting against cost externalities is a prime function of governmentshe also talks about how government should not provide services but instead let services be handled by businesses since they are more efficient one problem with this is what does efficiency look like for a government entity take police for example  should they make a certain number of arrests to fulfill quotas should we have only private police if you cannot afford private police do you not get protection or justice governments in democracies take actions on behalf of citizens as demanded and all are expected to pay up as appropriate for their economic statushe speaks of taxes as a form of coercion this is true people with guns will lock you in a cage if you do not pay up but where is a state without taxation there are failed states but these are run by warlords who extract tribute for protection  taxes by another name taxes will ultimately be paid and in exchange you ought to get civilizationbut lets say we magically get rid of taxes and everyone lives without government then some people and together and start doing crime what then you will need to form you own autodefense group complete with obligatory contributions in time material and money  taxes againif socialists gain support criticizing capitalism its because they have a point  many have their wants satisfied while many have their needs neglected this is a problem libertarians do not acknowledge capitalisms price signals do not distinguish between needs and wants a rich person can buy all the water for their pool while the impoverished go thirsty he talks about capitalism being the greatest mechanism for wealth creation that the world has ever seen and he talks about ever increasing gdppercapita figures but behind this hides the distribution of that wealth who actually has it do those without it have enough to survive to thrive to challenge the wealthy with better business offerings an enormous amount of wealth accumulated is coercive in its own right and balanced only by the collective will of the people  that is the rule of law under a democratic government milei is an extremist borne of extreme circumstances extremists are often have a point but are blinded to the flaws of their viewpoint just as the communists denigrated humanity for the promise of a utopia milei is so repelled by government that he cannot see its purposei hope that he delivers the shock that argentina needs to become peaceful and prosperous hopefully his corrections will not cause so many problems that it gives life to an extremist opposition
we will see if milei can solve the problems of argentina that will be the testin five years time we will know the answer
the comment section is scary nobody seems to realize that this is just another extreme just because its opposing to the current oppression doesnt make it perfect hitler got to power exactly this wayunfortunately a passionate speaker can make any ideology sound good he could sell socialism just the same if he wantedhe says a lot of good things but that just makes it more dangerousa good rule of thumb is to avoid simplistic solutions and extremist views
they are not only controlling us by controlling our money they also have created huge surveillance networks i was born in east germany under communism and saw the wall coming down as a child i felt myself extremely lucky i saw the communists taking over whole of germany again green party and social democrats and fled to poland where i thougth the polish people wont allow these idiots into government now they voted this communist eu puppet tusk into power the young generation forgot the suffering of poland under communism they want more bureaucracy and a bigger state and not more freedom
protect this man at all costs especially from klaus
the enemy of capitalism is corruption
thank you for being a student of ayn rand and speaking the truth especially your acknowledgement of the businessmen in the last part of the speech ayn ran until now was the only person who thanked businessmen for their accomplishments in the world thank you president milei
boring but dangerous speech  yes we all know what capitalism is and that communism does not work  however to suggest that capitalism cant be moderated with social justice is just a far right wolf cry and should be avoided just as much as far left calls to full socialismcommunism  yes gdp is growing more than ever now however the middle class is also shrinking now and their economic growth for the past 50 years has been almost flat  you have to address these inequalities or the door opens for extremism  keep in mind pure capitalism drove monopolies and extremely poor working conditions for much of the 19th and early 20th centuries  putting into place socalled social justice programs to mitigate these conditions enabled gdp growth across economic sectors it was these changes in addition to gdp growth that shrunk poverty
this was so good 
the so called free western world government is the champion of sanctions they act like a tyrant to smaller economic countries and through a threat of sanctions if their policy and interest is not followed thats how evil the western countries and its allies act
agreed imagine if the us elected this guy
this video should be played in a social science class along with an opposing point of view video as well followed by the teacher letting students openly debate each other and then unbiasedly evaluated for grades based on participation unfortunately none of this will happen
a warning
meanwhile unfettered capitalism is destroying the environment and countless lives there are homeless people everywhere in the us now and the wealth gap is growing faster than ever there are winners and losers in capitalism those with capital win those without lose those who would are willing to adopt nefarious practices are generally the winners which is exactly what we dont want the idea of capitalism is great but in practice it has no other possible long term outcome than severe inequality for capitalism to work as intended it needs revision
chefs kiss so inspiring and hopeful
holy shit imagine someone speaking up about what actually made the first world countries we live in as prosperous as it is capitalism encourages wealth freedom and liberty communism encourages poverty control and oppression just through the incentive structures alone you cannot have anyone regardless of how moral they are as the entity that decides the flow of resources across an entire nation the hubris to assume that you personally know better than the wisdom of the greater populace the market is absurd and people who spout such bs should be ridiculed to their faces for uttering such nonsense
he has a ted talk where he shows the numbers
very good speech
glad someone finally said what is obvious to everyone but the leaders
was it socialism or corruption and bad economic policies and planning that caused economic collapse in argentina its corruption under capitalism or socialism that is the problem tax systems that are so complex only the wealthy with a legal team can legally find loopholes to avoid paying taxes  hes forgetting to mention that capitalism so far has worked out because of cheap labor and resources somewhere else we need a balanced approach where workers receive fair pay and taxed is paid fairly he forgets to mention that as ceo pay has grown astronomically wages for workers in the usa have been stagnant quality of life in the usa has deteriorated for the middle class and poor there is no absolute in life we need a balanced and fair approach
viva la libertad y argentina 
its easy said then done this guy is full of hot air show me what you can do with your argentinian economic plan stop blaming the elite and the communist for the shortcomings of the great country of argentinathe argentinians have had a nonfunctional government for along time just like most countries in sawith lots of internal corruption within their government for many decades of military government
he identified the wrong enemy how can social justice be the enemy you can have both the assumptions hes making with this argument are huge and illogical
meh
with milei in charge im happy to invest my hard earned money into argentina to bring jobs prosperity and hope to the nation ive always liked argentinians but their leaders have been way too communist argentina is going to rise fast with that mindset
we love  
hes giving a nationalist speech at a globalist forum  love it
ganz nett hier aber waren sie schonmal in badenw√ºrtemberg
we all need a leader as mr milei probably they the so called west will do everything to bring him down
i thought for sure that this was benny hill from the thumbnail 
i cant believe they let him say those things at such a anti western freedom forum
moar chainsaws
we have a unelected puppet as pm in the uk if you wish to see a corrupt globalist look no further than the uk
javier milei  what an incredible speech omg i cant believe they didnt try to stop youshut you upi hope you mean every word  act upon it if you do increase your security guardsprotection as the bastards will be after your blood
im moving to argentina
long live freedom
this dude says women are more free when theyre not aloud to end a pregnancy
guess im gonna move to argentina holy hell this is based concise professional and most importantly true
the tide is turning 
thanks for the audio translation
thats all great blah blah  free market  capitalism without any checks and balances leads to run away free market where greed and power take over and everyone else is a slave to the man
brilliant  
he is the donald trump of europe   making argentina great again  globalists will try to take him down too
well said
agree with most of the speech except with his defense of monopolies if i got that right monopolies can raise prices through manipulation or short term cutthroat pricing which in the long term can hurt consumers also the state needs to insure costs are assigned to producers to properly reflect market conditions example is making sure oil companies are assigned cost of plastification of the seas and environment as well as carbons released this can be done through regulations rather than excessive taxation which i agree is counterproductive other than those caveats i wholeheartedly agree
free market capitalism did not free the world of poverty  efficiency and technology did   walking 4 hours to get water and food vs driving to the store then turning on the faucet for water happened in capitalist and socialist countries but only one sent a man to outer space first  the soviet union
is that benny hill
thank you so much farzad for bringing this to my attention  it confirms what i think about my employer and state
my dad who escaped from communist hungary in the 50s was taught in school there that socialism is the first step towards communism  why do so many people want to escape from communist countries
in 1900 argentina rivalled australia for prosperitythen fascism ruled for a century destroying economy majority of peoples livesyet you advocate returning to that timeits beyond belieflearn about median about percentiles about imbalancethis is dystopian like trump tea party brexit
i think politicians and economists often miss the enormous role of the enlightenment in making the world richer and free the enlightenment is about freedom in terms of exchanging ideas and a tradition of criticism and capitalism freedom in terms of trade so they go together  but i would argue the enlightenment is even more fundamental to how the world has changed and the hockey stick graph he refereed to
amazing speech   we need more leadership like him around the world
did he sit down for interview  wonder where that video is
thanks farzad
who invited this guy
great
it sounds lik at least part of the data in he beginning was sourced from a gpt still a great speech but oddly specific historical statistics
i completely agree
capitalism unchecked is taking america down the wealth gap is despicable and increasing the whales own the politicians the world and the plebs true capitalism prevents the whales from gobbling up the all of the fish in the ocean
that guy is a gem
greatest  really  its just another partial perspective on the whole  in this populist era both right and left have good ideas but act as though they had the only good ideas  but good luck to this guy he has a huge job ahead of him
aloha farzad i love your vlog and watch every episode and still will but i cannot believe you actually praise this grotesque delusional dishonest speech it is so unfair and unreasonable its difficult to fathom aloha
capitalism second only to religion in its creation of suffering is limitless pursuit of wealth on a limited planet
translation have many mistakes ie 0033 experiments he means colectivists experiments or 100th 40th position he really mean 140th position and so on
wtg farzad  dont sell yourself out to crudeness
dont let this bullshit fool you technology is the cause of human production advancement wealth and growth not political or economic policy
viva la libertad carajo  priceless
he used the strategy of gone with the wind the last word lol
what ai software is used in making his ai speech
im amazed that wef let him speak you will own nothing and be happy is socialism with another name there are thousands of words used for socialism to trick the next victims into its prison socialism is authoritarian economics practiced by hitler mao stalin pol pot the previous leaders of argentina the biden regime and its wef backers
it all sounds true except seriously how do you stop monopolies becoming quasi gov i think the only way would be to put a cap on entity wealth forcing cell division
south america 
while mileis speech focused on the economic aspects of freedom and capitalism its crucial to remember that these principles cannot thrive in a vacuum a robust and vibrant democracy is the fertile ground where these principles can flourish and lead to a truly prosperous and just societyits essential to engage in a nuanced discussion about the relationship between democracy capitalism and freedom we need to acknowledge the interdependence of these concepts and strive to build economic systems that uphold both individual liberties and democratic values
argentina just became the best country to live in the near future in south africahay que estar in poquito loco para cambiar dr√°sticamente pero es inevitable tesla elonshould look into opening a factory in argentina now if they can keep this dude alive congratulations argentina 
love it
wow i have goosebumps from that speech
as a australian and a longtime follower farzad im so happy your posting thiswe need help down under our government has lost control
charles never works
this wow rational and practical not what i expected
a speech to send fear into the intellectuals and theocrats freedom for the people and damn the others advocating enslavement
really surprised he was given this opportunity to speak in this forum at all as it against all that the wef is against
eher nicht
i love the part where he listed the opposing groups and stated theyre all the same this is why when meloni in italy was elected as a right wing nationalist she carried on the same globalist policies
damm milei crushed
wow is he right on
great
people who havent alreadyplease read the book confessions of an economic hitman
man this guy can speak
he talked to his dead dog first one can tell wouf crypto stil getting taken out in full
without doubt cant stop watching should play this at all universities cant help but wonder howwhy the wef invited him what did they think he was going to say bloody amazing
son of trump without the instant tan
oh god protect us from economic idealistswe are well past the thatcher  reagan erabest societies rely on mixed economyexternalities agw is good example environmental damage is real will bite us on posterior eventuallywe dont have knowledge base to understand what we are destroying couldnt hope to recreate dna evolution ecology microbiology atmospheric physics we arent gods not even beta versionusa  argentina is result of stealing a land by forceplease dont go down libertarian rabbit hole itll be interesting what agi makes of these ideas
frazad are you just being hyperbolic good speech but not the greatest
this is bull shit they seek fascism power and control he will remove freedom and beat down any opposition free markets are what we have he states that we are more free and better off than ever before but starts out that we are headed to socialism freedom to pollute freedom to ignore climate change freedom to deregulate food safety pharmaceutical safety and healthcare
finally
welcome to the 21st century where each debate is as unnuanced as it can get world is black and white because middle aged peoples brains function just like they did when they were 10
hell never get invited back thereglobalists probably let him there just to point and laugh then let him knowheyget in line or well release the jackals on ya
740 free markets without state intervention are not possible this guy is very ideological driven pure populism
oh my god  this man is so correct
thanks
he is so right man of the times fronts up
heres the original  the ai edited version using heygen 
simply amazing  spectacular speech 
0224 western world leaders abandoning freedom for collectivism leads to poverty and economic deprivation0448 global per capita gdp has multiplied by more than 15 times since the industrial revolution lifting 90 of the worlds population out of poverty0712 social justice is unfair and impedes general wellbeing0936 libertarianism is about respecting others life project and defending life liberty and property1200 neoclassical economic theory undermines the foundations of wealth and prosperity1424 neoclassical economists advocate against state intervention in the market economy1648 neomarxists have coopted the common sense of the western world1908 economic freedom limited government and respect for private property are vital for prosperity
yall better listen to this man the word is out we are under attack
i get the point but wasnt a great speech today isnt peaceful and late stage capitalism has taken hold apple uses dubious labour to make iphones so the entrepreneurship doesnt look good in that light but i still get his point we are in bailout culture central planning restricted freedoms  degrading education growing welfare
socialism is not a form of government  here are a  list of socialist countries that are still functioning well maybe better than the us in some cases moldova armenia croatia slovenia portugal spain belgium ireland netherlands china  a democratic socialist society has always been better  look at what roosevelt achieved
is millei speaking the truth or spreading misinformation
as an atheist we are animals 
wicked economic forum starts with witch prayer
wow so many logical fallacies its difficult to even count
ehhhhh a lot of stuff is right but saying that we need growth at all cost even with destroying the environment and that monopolies are good its a bit too muchthe data is good but need to respect the planet that we have and im saying this as someone who loves spacex  becoming multiplanetary and who has 80 of its liquidity on tesla
communism is the best with free education camps
wow ai language is crazyjavier doesnt speak english lmaothe translation even changed his mouth movements to english
viva javier
not too shabby
we need a free market for evs no more subsidies no more electricity market manipulation that would massively increase the adoption of evs because electricity at market prices is 810 c far cheaper than gasoline and elon and byd are getting the ev prices below that of ice cars no chance for ice unless we have this corrupt crony socialist system continue to mess things up
farzad indeed a very interesting speech
100
based vid poster is based
instantly this guy is the most hated man in the upper circles
maravilha nosso guerreiro na torcida muita luz me representa minha total admira√ß√£o e respeito para como nossos irm√£os t√£o sofrido por gestores anteriores deus no comando de tudo
wowwhat an amazing speech need a leader like that in the us
awesome speech excellent and precise
why cant we get a guy like this to run for president in the us
im happy to hear you say this thanks for sharing and spreading the wealth
there is room here for great misunderstanding  nb correlation does not imply causation
viva la libertad carajo
we would not have wars if it were not for governments that want to force someone else to do what they dont want to do it is never the people of nations that want war just those that profit from it
ive been meaning to catch this speech and im happy to support your channel while doing to also the super cut is objectively convenient
it really is
well done javier thanks for sharing farzad
this might be the best time to put a tesla gigafactory in argentina will argentina stay the course with this wise man
im surprised to hear that farzad likes the argentinian president
