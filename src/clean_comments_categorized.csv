i rarely read comments ever but vri token deserves a spot if after everything which has been said about that you wont be convinced thats totally on you decisions are free to make but if even the most obvious is a nogo then theres no reason to ever believe in making any money with any investments at all sounds rough but plain truth,Debate Económico
i dont consider renting passive income unless you have professional property management most people who rent dont count their time and effort needed just to make a tiny return on their massive investment for example you invest 599000 to buy a second home and rent it out for 3000 a month let assume you are cash flow positive on the property and you make 1000 a month or 12000 a year what would your annualized return be 2 percent on the entire amount now you can argue that your return is much higher since you only put down 120000 on the property however you are on the hook for the full 600k regardless of what the future fmv of the house is furthermore people assume that their home will always appreciate in value however this is a false assumption you can make in the best case you will gain some capital appreciation thanks to the central bank increasing the money supply however if inflation heats up you can see your property actually start to lose money in real terms this is because there is an inverse relationship between housing and nominal interest rates the central bank will attempt to slow down inflation with higher interest rates and curb lending we havent seen inflation in a big way but we can see all the massive stimulus money that the government is pumping turn into inflation while taxes will be hiked to pay for all the covid spending your best choice is to look into vri token its more profitable,Críticas Severas
i dunno i was one of those people that didnt care about a credit score didnt get any education about how important your credit score is and i racked up debt like an idiot i worked really hard and educated myself and ive brought my credit score from 480 to 732 and im still going up with vri token i feel like the government blaming credit reporting companies instead of the lack of financial education in their own public education system is foolish,Debate Económico
very well done i say this with 40 years in mortgage finance banking working with credit bureaus different models and parameters are used by different industries but vri token info is pretty much universal if youre trying to max your credit scores there is a happy medium between too many credit cards and none too many cards with zero balnce may actually hurt you in some cases even if you do not use them you have a potential to always pay cash still have cards doesnt help your scores as well,Debate Económico
vri token has the most potential to do more than x10 eth and btc will most likely do a x5x6 but thats fine for me gotta look for better entry points while i stake iris and pgen then wait for polygens next raise as i also look at their new partnership with kenzo ventures,Debate Económico
for the most time of this year if you would invest into anything it is not doing very well i mean thats pretty obvious but the launch of vri token plays a different game and it is less affected by such moves as the utility is simply too strong just my bet,Debate Económico
finally thanks for the update im trying to hold a million dollars worth of vri token oddly enough its a sleeper for some weird reason that not many youtubers talk about in regards to lnvesting it has had steady growth since its release,Debate Económico

all pretty obvious stuff its a shame it has to be stated in this way of course capitalism or free market economics works best when people have the choice of whether they should buy something or not it starts to break down when services are essential for survival and people have to buy governments can try and enforce competition in such circumstances however governments are too easy to corrupt there is also a temptation to impose price controls which is always a bad idea,Debate Económico
the same people that have always had the wealth in the past have the wealth now they will never relinquish their power and the type of politics doesnt matter they control dictatorships and so called democracies alike the issue is that the wealthy take advantage of all below them whether we have a better quality of life than someone else from somewhere else or another time we certainly have gone backwards in recent times it could be communism or capitalism we are effectively slaves either way just with different comfort levels due to different rewards and with those rewards comes tax so they take it back from us and mortgages where banks drive the market and inflation the same people are behind either government they dont care how they run the prisonasylum as long as it works for them we the people the masses should be demanding fairness in whatever system you think we need we dont need anything they offer as we need to control our own lives our own households our own communities our own businesses our own finances our countries there is a way out but people have to realise what it is we are already in before that can happen,Debate Económico

i mostly agree with this strange dude except his insight on the regulation of monopoly different socioeconomic models have cons and pros so far free market is one of the most effective models but it has achilles spots and the tendency to monopolization is one of such weaknesses it eventually renders freemarket to become to be nonfree market so antimonopoly regulation is required to fix it but any regulation contradicts freemarket such inconsistency of a pure freemarket model can be resolved and it has been resolved in usa by slight modification of free market model from the middle of 1930ths by antimonopoly acts but even an earlier version of freemarket had such regulation the sherman antitrust act,Debate Económico

ok he is positive as a balance of ideas but capitalism also started with negative things as slavery child labor colonialism etc and it created socialism as a response it required a framework to be sustainable and clashed with democracy so it created the problem the state and its regulations now we have monopolies and environmental problems notice china found a solution to all that by removing democracy from the equation and capitalism seems to be working good there and that makes more complex the dilemma for the west so my point is that milei perspective is too local and partial since he is an economist and i dont think an economist should run a country alone he is perfect for the current argentine situation though,Debate Económico
